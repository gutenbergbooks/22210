<h5>IN THE FORBIDDEN LAND</h5>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_iii" id="Pg_iii"></a>[<a href="./images/iii.png">iii</a>]</span></p>
<p><i>Times</i>: &quot;The ordinary reader will be struck with the portraits,
which show that in a very few weeks he must have endured a lifetime
of concentrated misery. Other travellers, no doubt, have gone
further, but none who have escaped with their lives have fared
worse.... Mr. Landor tells a plain and manly tale, without affectation
or bravado. It is a book, certainly, that will be read with
interest and excitement.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Athen&aelig;um</i>: &quot;The account he has written of his travels and
adventures is vivid and often fascinating. His frequent notices of
curious customs are full of interest, and numerous illustrations from
photographs or sketches taken on the spot render this one of the
most attractive records of travel published recently.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Guardian</i>: &quot;Life, according to Mr. Landor, has 'barely a
dull moment,' and the gloomiest of us will admit that this is at least
true of that part of life which may be devoted to the reading of his
latest book.&quot;</p>

<p><i>World</i>: &quot;He has contrived, even in circumstances of cruel disadvantage,
to present a wonderfully minute and impressive series of
pictures of the life, manners, and customs of the Tibetans. No less
powerful and vivid are his descriptions of the scenery and natural
phenomena of the Forbidden Land, which are reinforced by an
ample series of illustrations that attain a high standard of artistic
excellence. Mr. Landor's bitter experiences have had at least the
advantage of providing him with material for the most absorbing
travel book produced within recent times.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Daily Telegraph</i>: &quot;Mr. Landor's story is one of the most extraordinary
tales of modern times, yet even the most sceptical reader
will admire the vigour with which it is told, and the endurance with
which the explorer and his faithful servants bore up against their
savage captors.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Standard</i>: &quot;The book fascinates ... The verbal pictures it
gives are extremely vivid, and the effect of them is greatly
heightened by the numerous drawings and photographs by the
author. Mr. Landor is an artist as well as traveller and writer, and
he knows how to use his pencil and brush to emphasise his letter-press.
Whatever may be said of the wisdom of his enterprises, his
book is certainly a remarkable contribution to the literature of
modern travel.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Daily News</i>: &quot;The great library of travel in the East has not
received for many a year a more important addition than this
bright, picturesque, and instructive volume.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Daily Chronicle</i>: &quot;Mr. Landor is an artist as well as a writer,
and this handsome volume is most lavishly illustrated with sketches
and photographs. Apart from its intense interest as a story of
stirring adventure, the book is a valuable storehouse of information
on Southern Tibet and its people, and on the little known Indian
district of Northern Kumaon. This is surely a record of devotion
to geographical science such as no previous explorer has been able
to show.&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> this book I have set down the record of a journey
in Tibet undertaken by me during the spring, summer
and autumn of 1897. It is illustrated partly from my
photographs and partly from sketches made by me on
the spot. Only as regards the torture scenes have I
had to draw from memory, but it will be easily
conceded that their impression must be vivid enough
with me.</p>

<p>The map is made entirely from my surveys of
an area of twelve thousand five hundred square miles
in Tibet proper. In Chapter VI. the altitudes of
such high peaks in India as Nanda Devi and others
are taken from the Trigonometrical Survey, and so
are the positions fixed by astronomical observations of
the starting and terminating points of my surveys at
the places where I entered and left Tibet.</p>

<p>In the orthography of geographical names I have
adopted the course advised by the Royal Geographical
Society&mdash;viz., to give the names their true sound as
they are locally pronounced, and I have made no
exception even for the grand and poetic &quot;Himahlya&quot;
which is in English usually distorted into the unmusical
and unromantic word &quot;Himalayas.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_x" id="Pg_x"></a>[<a href="./images/x.png">x</a>]</span>
I submit with all deference the following geographical
results of my expedition:</p>

<p>The solution of the uncertainty regarding the
division of the Mansarowar and Rakstal Lakes.</p>

<p>The ascent to so great an altitude as 22,000
feet, and the pictures of some of the great Himahlyan
glaciers.</p>

<p>The visit to and the fixing of the position of the
two principal sources of the Brahmaputra, never before
reached by a European.</p>

<p>The fact that with only two men I was able to travel
for so long in the most populated part of Tibet.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, I am glad to state
that owing to the publicity which I gave on my
return to the outrageous Tibetan abuses taking
place on British soil, the Government of India at last,
in the summer of 1898, notified the Tibetan authorities
that they will no longer be permitted to collect
Land Revenue from British subjects there. This
fact gives me special satisfaction, because of the
exceptional courtesy and kindness bestowed on me
by our mountain tribesmen, the Shokas.</p>

<p>The Government Report of the official Investigation
of my case, as well as other documents substantiating
the details of my narrative, are printed in
an appendix.</p>

<h5>FROM LONDON TO NAINI TAL</h5>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/1.jpg">
<img src="./images/1_th.jpg" alt="A Chinese Passport" title="A Chinese Passport" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">A Chinese Passport</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> leaving London, I intended to proceed <i>vi&acirc;</i> Germany to
Russia, traverse Russian Turkestan, Bokhara and Chinese
Turkestan, and from there enter Tibet. The Russian Government
had readily granted me a special permission to take
free of duty through their territory my firearms, ammunition,
provisions, photographic cameras, surveying and other
scientific instruments, and moreover informed me, through
H.E. Sir Nicholas O'Conor, then our Ambassador in St.
Petersburg, that I should be privileged to travel on the
military railway through Turkestan, as far as the terminus at
Samarakand. I feel under a great obligation to the Russian
Embassy in London for the extreme courtesy shown me,
and I desire to acknowledge this at the outset, especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_2" id="Pg_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>
because that route might very likely have saved me much of
the suffering and disappointment I was subjected to through
going by way of India.</p>

<p>I was provided with introductions and credentials from
the Marquis of Salisbury, the British Museum of Natural
History, etc., I was carrying scientific instruments for the
Royal Geographical Society, and I had a British and two
Chinese passports.</p>

<p>Having forwarded all my explosives by an ammunition
vessel to Russia (the German railways absolutely refusing to
carry cartridges), I heard to my dismay, only a few days
previous to leaving London, that the steamer had stranded
just before reaching her port of destination, and that grave
doubts were entertained as to the possibility of saving even a
portion of her cargo. This was at the time of the outbreak
of the Turco-Greek War, and the Russians were reported to
be mobilising their troops along the Afghan frontier. I did
not wish to delay my journey, and although my preparations
were complete for going through Russia, I nevertheless
decided to abandon that plan and go to India, with a view
to penetrating over the Himahlya into Tibet. I sailed for
India on March 19, on the P. and O. ss. <i>Peninsular</i>, and
reached Bombay three weeks later.</p>

<p>It was my first visit to India, and my first impression was
certainly not a good one. The heat was intense, and signs
of the plague were discernible everywhere. The streets
were deserted and the hotels bad and dirty for want of
servants, who had abandoned the town in fear of the
scourge.</p>

<p>Accompanied by a Parsee friend, I went to several of the
districts of Bombay chiefly affected by the disease, but I
noticed, wherever I went, little else than a strong odour of
disinfectants. It is true there were few houses in those
parts which had not ten, twenty, and even more circular red
marks, denoting as many deaths, and on one door, which I
photographed, I counted no less than forty-nine circles.
But I was unable to gauge personally with any sort of
accuracy the nature or extent of the disease, beyond seeing
in the hospitals a few violent cases of bubonic attacks.</p>

<p>On the day following my arrival in Bombay, I proceeded
by rail to Bareilly, which was reached in three days, and
from there one more night brought me to Kathgodam, the
terminus of the railway line. Travelling partly by Tonga (a
two-wheeled vehicle drawn by two horses) and partly on
horseback, I found myself at last at Naini Tal, a hill station
in the lower Himahlyas and the summer seat of the Govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_3" id="Pg_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>ment
of the North-West Provinces and Oudh, from whence
I wrote to the Lieutenant-Governor, informing him of my
intention to proceed to Tibet. I also called on the Deputy-Commissioner
and made him fully acquainted with my
plans. Neither one nor the other of these gentlemen raised
the slightest objection to my intended journey into the
sacred Land of the Lamas.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h5>Loads&mdash;A set of useful pack-saddle cases&mdash;Provisions and
scientific outfit&mdash;Clothes and shoes&mdash;Medicines&mdash;Under way&mdash;The
first march&mdash;Servants&mdash;How I came to employ faithful
Chanden Sing.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">I knew</span> that from Naini Tal, 6407 feet (sixty feet above lake
level), all my loads would have to be transported on the backs
of coolies, and therefore they had to be divided into equal
weights not exceeding twenty-five seers, or fifty pounds. I
packed instruments, negatives, and articles liable to get
damaged, in cases of my own make designed especially for
rough usage. A set of four such cases, of well-seasoned deal
wood, carefully joined and fitted, zinc-lined, and soaked in a
special preparation of mine by which they were rendered
water and air tight, could be made useful in many ways.
Taken separately, they could be used as seats; four placed
in a row answered the purpose of bedstead; three could be
used as seat and table; and the combination of four used in
a certain manner made a punt or boat of quick, solid, and
easy construction, by which an unfordable river could be
crossed or soundings taken in the still waters of a lake. The
cases could also be used as baths for myself and my followers
(if I could induce these to so far indulge), and also in the
developing of my negatives as tanks to properly wash my
plates. I conjectured even that in case of emergency they
might serve as water casks in arid regions, if I should have
to traverse any. One of these boxes packed was exactly a
coolie load, and two could be easily slung over a pack-saddle
by means of straps and rings. It was due mainly to the
stoutness and strength of these cases that, notwithstanding
the amount of knocking about they got, my photographic
and painting work, as well as my maps, instruments, etc.,
were really in no way injured until we fell into the hands of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_5" id="Pg_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
the Tibetans. Fortunately, the most important part of my
work, from a scientific point of view, had already been
accomplished. My provisions were prepared for me by the
Bovril Company after instructions furnished by me, with a
view to the severe Tibetan climate and the altitudes we
should find ourselves in. They contained a vast amount of
fat and carbonaceous food, as well as ingredients easily
digestible and calculated to maintain one's strength even in
moments of unusual stress. I had them packed in tin cases
and skin bags. I carried in a water-tight box 1000 cartridges
for my 256&deg; Mannlicher rifle, besides 500 cartridges for my
revolver, and a number of hunting knives, skinning implements,
wire traps of several sizes for capturing small
mammals, butterfly nets, bottles for preserving reptiles in
alcohol, insect-killing bottles (cyanide of potassium), a
quantity of arsenical soap, bone nippers, scalpels, and all
other accessories necessary for the collection of natural
history specimens. There were three sets of photographic
apparatus in my outfit, and one hundred and fifty-eight
dozen dry plates, as well as all adjuncts for the developing,
fixing, etc. of the negatives as they were taken. The collecting
materials were given me by the British Museum of
Natural History, to which institution I had promised to
present all specimens of fauna and flora I might collect
during my journey. I had two sets of instruments for
astronomical observation and for use in surveying (one of
which had been furnished me by the Royal Geographical
Society), such as the six-inch sextant, hypsometrical apparatus
for measuring heights, with boiling-point thermometers
specially constructed for very great altitudes; two aneroids,
one to 20,000 feet, the other to 25,000 feet; three artificial
horizons (one mercury, the others plate-glass with levels); a
powerful telescope with astronomical eyepiece and stand;
a prismatic, a luminous, a floating, and two pocket compasses;
maximum and minimum thermometers, a case of drawing
instruments, protractors, parallel rules, tape rules, a silver
water-tight half-chronometer watch and three other watches,
section paper in books and in large sheets, Raper's and the
Nautical Almanac for 1897 and 1898.</p>

<p>Not to neglect the artistic aspect of my expedition, I had
provided myself with ample painting and drawing materials,
and I trust to the appearance of my sketches in these
volumes to prove that I did not carry them in vain.</p>

<p>I was provided with a very light mountain <i>tente-d'abri</i>
seven feet long, four feet wide, and three feet high. Well
accustomed to the sort of travelling I was in for, I decided
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_6" id="Pg_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>
that I required for myself only a camel-hair blanket in the
way of bedding. I reduced my clothing also to a minimum
and made no difference in it from start to finish. The only
thing I ever missed was my straw hat, which I wore up in
the Himahlyas just as I had worn it in the broiling plains,
because it seemed to me always the most comfortable
headgear. It was rendered unwearable through the
clumsiness of one of my Shokas to whom I had lent it to
carry in it some swan eggs (presented by a friendly Shoka),
and who fell with it, or on it, to the detriment and destruction
both of vessel and load. After that I generally went about
with my head uncovered, as I only had a small cap left, which
was not comfortable. I wore medium thick shoes without
nails, and never carried a stick, and I think it was due
largely to the simplicity of my personal equipment that I was
able, as will be seen presently, to climb to one of the greatest
altitudes ever reached by a human being.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>My provision of medicines cost me only half-a-crown,
firm as I am in the belief that man, living naturally under
natural conditions, and giving himself plenty of exercise, can
be helped very little by drugs.</p>

<p>And thus I started.</p>

<p>On the first day I rode from Naini Tal to Almora, thirty
miles by the lower and well-known road <i>vi&acirc;</i> Khairna.</p>

<p>Almora (5510 feet) is the last hill station towards the
frontier where I expected to find a European, or rather an
Anglo-Indian, community, and I made it my headquarters
for a few days. It was my intention to obtain some reliable
hill men, possibly Gourkhas, to accompany me. I applied
in vain for this purpose to the Lieut.-Colonel of the
1st 3rd Gourkha Regiment quartered in the station, duly
showing letters, introductions, and documents from the
highest authorities and institutions in England, plainly
demonstrating the scientific object of my journey to
Tibet.</p>

<p>The superior authorities seemed open to negotiations had
I been able to afford a wait of several months; but, as this
would have involved the postponement of my journey for a
year on account of the passes leading into Tibet becoming
impassable at the end of the summer, I decided to snap my
fingers at all the red tape the job required, and to start on
my journey without the Gourkhas.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, I came across a gentleman at
Almora, a Mr. J. Larkin, who showed me great politeness
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_7" id="Pg_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>
and gave me much useful information with regard to the roads, the mode of
travelling, etc. on the British side of the Tibetan frontier. He had
himself travelled nearly up to the boundary the previous year, and knew
that part of Kumaon better than any Anglo-Indian in the province. In
fact, with the exception of Colonel Grigg, Commissioner of Kumaon, Mr.
Larkin is the only other official who has any knowledge at all of the
north-east of Kumaon, now so neglected by the Government of the N.W.P.</p>

My Faithful Companion</div>
<p>Gourkhas being unobtainable, the question weighed heavily on my mind of
obtaining plucky, honest, wiry, healthy servants, of whatever caste they
might be, who would be ready for the sake of a good salary and a handsome
reward to brave the many discomforts, hardships, and perils my expedition
was likely to involve. Both at Naini Tal and here scores of servants and
Shikaris (sporting attendants) offered themselves. They one and all
produced &quot;certificates&quot; of good conduct, irreproachable
honesty, good-nature and willingness to work, and praises unbounded of
all possible virtues that a servant could possess. Each certificate was
duly ornamented with the signature of a General, a Captain, a
Lieut.-Governor, or some other considerable personage, but each bearer of
such testimonial seemed sadly neglected by those who had been so
enthusiastically pleased with his services, for he invariably commenced
by asking for a loan of several rupees to purchase boots and blankets,
and to enable him to support a wife with or without a family whom he
would be leaving behind.</p>

<p>I decided that my means did not permit of my supporting
&quot;the dear ones at home&quot; of the two or three dozen followers
I should require, and I made up my mind to wait and see
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_8" id="Pg_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
whether I could not find men to suit me farther on my road
without involving myself in the liability of supporting the
entire population I left behind me. I made only one exception.
I was sitting one fine day in my room at the D&acirc;k
Bungalow (post resting-house) when an odd creature entered
and offered his services, salaaming me.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are your certificates?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Sahib, hum 'certificates' ne hai!</i>&quot; (&quot;Sir, I have no certificates.&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;Well, then I may employ you.&quot;</p></div>

<p>I had previously had a good look at the fellow. His facial
lines showed considerably more character and force than I
had noticed in the features of other local natives. His attire
was peculiar. He wore a white turban, and from under a
short velvet waistcoat there protruded a gaudy flannel shirt
in yellow and black stripes, which he wore oddly outside of
his pyjamas instead of in them. He had no shoes, and
carried in his right hand an old cricket stump, with which
he &quot;presented arms,&quot; as it were, every time that I came in
and went out of the room. I at once decided to try him.
It was about nine o'clock in the morning, when I, having
many people to see, handed Chanden Sing, for that was his
name, a pair of shoes and some blacking.</p>

<p>&quot;Mind I find them clean when I return.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Acha, Sahib</i>.&quot; (&quot;All right, sir!&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;You will find some brushes in my room.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Bahut acha, Sahib</i>.&quot; (&quot;Very good, sir!&quot;)</p>

<p>I left. At six p.m. when I returned to my quarters I found
Chanden Sing still polishing my footgear with all his might.
He had been at it the whole day and had used for the
purpose my best hair and clothes brushes.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you <i>budmash! crab log, pagal!</i>&quot; (&quot;Oh! you bad
character! bad man, fool!&quot;) I exclaimed, disgusted, making
as much display as possible of the only three or four words
I then knew of Hindustani. I snatched the blackened articles
of toilet out of his hands, while he, with an air of wounded
feelings, pointed out the wonderful results he had achieved.</p>

<p>It was clear that Chanden Sing was not much of a valet,
neither was he a master at opening soda-water bottles. He
generally managed to give you a spray bath if he did not
actually shoot the flying cork in your face. It was owing to
one (by no means the first) of these accidents that Chanden
Sing, having hit me full, was a few days later flung bodily out
of the front door. I am very adverse to the habit of punishing
the natives injudiciously and unjustly, but I believe that
firm if not too severe a punishment administered in time</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_10" id="Pg_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
is absolutely necessary with native servants, and generally
saves much trouble and unpleasantness in the end. Anyhow
Chanden Sing, none the worse, returned the next day to fetch
his cricket stump which he had forgotten in his hurried and
involuntary departure. He seized this opportunity to offer
his humblest apologies for his clumsiness, and produced the
following letter which he had got written in English by a
Babu in the Bazaar:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am a stupid man, but I hear you intend to
take two Gourkha soldiers with you to Tibet. I am a good
and very <i>stout</i> man and therefore far superior to any Gourkha.
Please employ me.</p>

<p>&quot;Your faithful servant,</p>

<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">Chanden Sing</span>.&quot;</p></div>

<p>This was touching, and I forgave him and allowed him to
stay. He improved as time went on, and after a while
became quite tolerable. One morning Mr. Larkin called when
Chanden Sing happened to be about.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; said Larkin.</p>

<p>&quot;That is my bearer.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But he is not a bearer! He was once a policeman, and
a smart fellow too. He worked out a good case in his own
village and had many people arrested and convicted for
theft. As a reward they sacked him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am thinking of taking him with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;He is a good lad,&quot; replied Mr. Larkin. &quot;You can anyhow
take him as far as the frontier, but I would not advise
you to take him into Tibet.&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Larkin counselled Chanden Sing to be diligent and
attentive, and the ex-policeman beamed all over with joy
when I told him definitely that he might accompany me to
Bhot. He turned out to be the one plucky man among all
my followers, and he stood by me through thick and thin.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h5>Pithoragarh&mdash;Fakir women&mdash;A well-ventilated abode&mdash;Askote&mdash;The
Rajiwar and his people.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> country up to Bhot is comparatively well-known,
therefore I will not dwell at length on the first portion of
my journey.</p>

<p>On May 9 all my baggage, accompanied by two
<i>Chaprassis</i>, left on its way to the frontier, and I followed
on the next day. Two days' marching, at the rate of
twenty-five miles a day, brought me to Shor, otherwise
called Pithoragarh.</p>

<p>The road is good all the way, running through thick
forests of pine and fir trees, and you get here and there
pretty views of wooded mountain ranges. Nevertheless, it
is tiring owing to the many ascents and descents, as will be
seen from the following figures showing the principal elevations.
From 5510 feet we climbed to 7650 feet, descended
to 2475 feet, climbed again up to 6020 feet at Gangoli Hat,
and re-descended by a steep incline to 2500 feet. The
intense heat prevented me from walking at my usual pace,
and I did not, therefore, reach my destination before sundown.
Walking on in the dark, we saw the distant flickering
forest fires crawling here and there like incandescent
snakes along or up the mountain-side: these are caused
by the igniting of the grass, shrubs, and undergrowth
by the natives, the flames not unfrequently spreading and
playing havoc among the finest trees of the forest.</p>

<p>At Pithoragarh (6650 feet) there is the old London
Gourkha fort to be seen, on a hilltop, also a well-kept leper
hospital, a school, and a mission-house. The soil is fertile
and there are many stretches of well-cultivated land dotted
with habitations. Water is plentiful, and though the
scenery certainly lacks trees except in the immediate
neighbourhood of the villages and houses, it has, neverthe<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_12" id="Pg_12"></a>[<a href="./images/12.png">12</a>]</span>less,
a certain picturesqueness on account of its background
of wooded mountains. I started from Pithoragarh at
6.30 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>; leaving the road to Tal on the left, I followed the
track at a medium elevation of 6250 feet, arriving at
Shadgora (6350 feet) just in time to witness the blessing of
a calf by a Brahmin. Inside a diminutive shrine&mdash;into
the door of which I was curious enough to peep&mdash;I discovered
two skinny, repulsive old women, with sunken,
discoloured eyes, untidy locks of scanty hair, long unwashed,
bony arms and legs, and finger and toe nails of abnormal
length. They were clad in a few dirty rags, and were busily
attending to the lights burning on several primitive stone
candlesticks along the walls of the shrine. There were also
some curiously-shaped stones standing upright among the
candlesticks. The ceiling of this place of worship was not
high enough to allow the women to stand, and they were
compelled to crawl about inside on all fours. When they
saw me they stretched out their angular arms towards me,
begging for money. I gave them a silver coin, which they
shoved under one of the peculiar stones, and then, turning
round, immediately made violent gestures suggesting to me
that I was to depart.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Castle at Pithoragarh</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Farther on I came upon a point where three roads branched
off to Deolthal (six miles) on the left, to Askote (twelve
and three-quarter miles) in the centre, and to Pithoragarh
(eleven and a quarter miles), a different route from the one
followed, on the right. I took the middle one, and travelled
on in a storm of hail and wind with a constant deafening
roar of thunder and splendid flashes of lightning, which
produced magical effects on the ever-changing and fantastic
clouds and the weird mountain-sides along which I ploughed
my way.</p>

<img alt="My Abode at Askote" src="./images/14_th.jpg" title="My Abode at Askote" /></a><br />
My Abode at Askote</div>
<p>I arrived late in the evening at Askote, where there is
neither D&acirc;k Bungalow nor Daramsalla,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and found to my
disgust that none of my carriers had yet arrived. I was offered
hospitality by Pundit Jibanand, who put me up in his schoolroom, a
structure consisting of a number of planks put together regardless of
width, height, length, or shape, and supporting a roof of straw and
grass. The ventilation of my abode was all one could wish for, and as
during the night I lay wrapped up in my blanket under the sheltering
roof, I could admire through the disconnected portions of the walls the
brilliancy of the star-studded heaven above. When the sun arose, bits of
scenery appeared between plank and plank, until by degrees the gaps were
all stopped up by figures of natives, who took possession of these points
of vantage to gaze to their hearts' content on the sahib, who, with signs
of evident suspense on the part of these spectators, managed even to
shave. Hilarity, on the other hand, was caused when I smeared myself all
over with soap while bathing. Admiration followed at my putting on my
last starched shirt and other mysterious garments, but the excitement
grew almost to fever-heat when I went through the daily nuisance of
winding up my watches and registering daily observations of temperature,
etc. The strain was too much, I fancy, and a general stampede followed
the moment I touched my unloaded rifle.</p>

<p>The town of Askote is not unlike an old feudal castle such
as are found in many parts of Central Italy. Perched on
the crown of a central hill, the Rajiwar's palace overlooks a
fine panorama of mountains encircling it on all sides.
Among the higher peaks discernible from the palace are the
Chipla Mountain and the Dafia. Then across the Kali River,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_15" id="Pg_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
forming the boundary of Nepal, is Mount Dooti. The &quot;<i>gown</i>&quot;
or town itself numbers some two hundred houses scattered
on the slope of the hill, and includes a school, a post-office,
and two Mahommedan shops. The Rajiwar had on my
arrival just completed building a new Court, a simple and
dignified structure of brown stone, with fine wooden
carvings on the windows and doors, and with chimneys
in European fashion in each room. One wall in each
room was left open, and formed a charming verandah,
commanding a magnificent view of mountain scenery.</p>

<p>The Rajiwar of Askote occupies a unique position in
Kumaon. Having repurchased his right to the tenure of
land in the Askote Pargana as late as 1855, he now possesses
the right of <i>zamindar</i> (translated literally, <i>landed proprietor</i>),
and he is the only person to whom has been granted to
retain this privilege in the Kumaon Division. Jagat Sing
Pal, the Rajiwar's nephew, assured me that the people of the
Askote Pargana are brave and good-natured. They never
give any trouble to the Rajiwar, who, on the other hand, is
almost a father to them. They apply to him in every difficulty,
in sickness and distress, and he looks after them in
true patriarchal fashion. The Rajiwar is not rich, probably
because he spends so much for the benefit of his people and
of the strangers who pass through Askote. Many of these
are little more than beggars, of course, even when they travel
as fakirs, or other religious fanatics, going to or returning
from the sacred Mansarowar Lake in Tibet. The present
Rajiwar,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Pushkar Pal, belongs to the Ramchanda family,
and he is a descendant of the Solar dynasty. His ancestors
lived in Aoudh or Ayodye (as it was formerly called), whence
they migrated to the hills of Katyur in Kumaon, where they
built a palace. The hill regions up to Killakanjia and the
Jumua River were under the Raja of Katyur's rule, he assuming
the title of Maharaja. A branch of the family came from
Katyur to Askote, its chief retaining the hereditary title of
Rajiwar beside that of Pal, which each male assumes. The
Rajiwar pays a yearly tribute of 1800 rupees to the Government
of India. In the time of the Gourkhas he paid nothing
except occasional gifts of <i>Nafas</i> or musk-deer to his neighbour
the King of Nepal, with whom he is still in very close
relation. He was then practically an independent king.
Still Rajiwar Pushkar Pal has always been perfectly loyal to
the Government of India.</p></div>

<p>&quot;Are the people very obsequious to the Rajiwar?&quot; I asked
of Jagat Sing Pal.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_16" id="Pg_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>
&quot;Yes, sir. For instance, when the Rajiwar sits on his
<i>Karoka</i> (a kind of throne) he is saluted with a particularly
respectful salaam. His subjects bring their hand up to the
forehead and support the elbow with the left hand, as a sign
that this salutation is so weighty that it requires the support
of the other hand.&quot;</p>

<p>At Court functions, the male relatives, friends, and servants
sit near the Rajiwar, his brother first, his son next, then his
nephews, etc. Women are of course not admitted, and
although no strict code of etiquette exists, the Rajiwar and
his family are nevertheless always treated with Eastern
deference.</p>

A Young Man</div>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had walked seventy-eight miles in three marches, and my men being
footsore, I gave them a day's rest, which I employed in going to the
haunts of the &quot;Wild men of the forest,&quot; or <i>Raots</i> or <i>Rajis</i>,
as they style themselves. They live in the woods several miles off, and
to reach them I had to descend a steep incline covered by an uncommonly
slippery carpet of dried grass and pine needles. I had to take off shoes
and stockings to get along, and even bare-footed I found it difficult to
maintain my hold. I was accompanied by one of my chaprassis and a man
from Askote, and we were forced down more swiftly than comfortably till
we reached a faint track, which we followed until we came upon a man
hiding behind some trees. He was a wild-looking creature, naked and
unkempt, with flowing hair and scanty beard and moustache, and, regarding
us with an air of suspicion, he was most reluctant to show us the way to
the homes of his tribe. He was a Raot, and his reluctance to let us
approach his home seemed justified enough when he said to my guide,
&quot;No white man has ever visited our home, and should one ever come we
shall all die. The spirits of the mountains will prevent your
progress&mdash;not we. You will suffer pain, for the spirit who watches
over the Raots will let no one enter their homes.&quot;</p>

<p>I gave the man a rupee, which he turned and weighed in
his hand.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_18" id="Pg_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
&quot;You can come,&quot; he muttered, &quot;but you will regret it.
You will have great misfortune.&quot;</p></div>

<p>There was something so weirdly peculiar in the tone of voice in which the
man spoke, as if he had been in a trance, himself only the channel
through which the threat of some occult being was conveyed to us, that
for some minutes I could not get his words out of my head. I followed him
as best I could, for he climbed up huge boulders with the agility of a
monkey. It was no easy job, for we bounded and leapt from rock to rock
and vaulted over fallen trees. The track became more marked and went up
along the incline of a steep ravine. We continued until, hot and panting,
we arrived at a large hollow high up in the cliff of clay. There, on a
semicircular platform with entrenchments of felled trees, were about a
dozen men almost devoid of clothing, some sitting on their heels and
resting their arms on their knees, others lying down flat. One fellow
smoked dry leaves inside a pipe of Hindoo origin. I snatched a photo of
the group as, with an air of suspicion mingled with surprise and sadness,
but no apparent fear, they stared at the unexpected visitors. Two of the
elder men having overcome their first stupor sprang to their feet and
with mad gesticulations refused to let me come nearer. But I penetrated
right into their circle, and found myself surrounded by a sulky and angry
crowd.</p>

<p>&quot;No man has ever been here but a Raot. You will soon
die. You have offended God!&quot; screamed an old man, in a
sudden outburst of temper. He bent his knees and curved
his spine, protruding his head towards me. He shook his
fists in my face, waved them about in the air, opened and
tightly clenched them, digging his nails furiously into his
palms. Instead of contracting the scalp of his forehead, the old</p>

Raot raised his eyebrows and turned his polished forehead
into a succession of deep wrinkles, stretching in a straight
line across almost from ear to ear, and showing only a dark
dimple over his nose. His nostrils, flat and broad to begin
with, became widely expanded and raised so as to cause two
deep lines to diverge from the nose along his cheeks. His
mouth was open and a peculiar vacillation of the lower lip
demonstrated plainly that its owner had but little command
over speech and articulation. His eyes, which may have
been brown originally, were discoloured, probably through
the abuse of excessive animal powers, to the possession of
which the formation of his skull strongly testified, but they
assumed extraordinary brilliancy as his fury increased. He
opened them wide, apparently with an effort, and showed the
entire circle of his iris. The pupils were dilated, notwithstanding
that the light upon his face was strong at the time.</p>

<p>Following his example, some of the rest displayed their
discontent in a similar fashion, but others, among whom I
especially noticed two youths with sad languishing faces,
drooping large eyes, and luxuriant growth of black hair, stood
apathetically apart, with head reclining towards the right
shoulder, their features perfectly composed, and supporting
their chins on their hands. Even if they had overcome their
stupor, they did certainly not betray it, and appeared perfectly
emotionless as far as their countenances were concerned.</p>

<p>One fellow with an extraordinary head, a mixture it
seemed of a Mongolian and a Negroid type, was the first to
calm himself of those who were so madly excited. With
piercing though unsteady eyes, and with nervous twitching
movements, he scrutinised my face more closely than the
others, and seemed to reassure them all that I had not come
to hurt them. He made signs to the rest to desist from their
threats, and then, squatting down himself, invited me to
follow his example, by sitting on my heels. When the storm
had subsided and they had all sat down, I drew out of my
pocket some coins and gave one to each of them, with the
exception of one man on whom I thought I might study the
passion of jealousy in its most primitive form. I watched
the man closely, and soon saw him draw apart from the others
and become sulky. The others were by now comparatively
calm. They seemed predisposed towards sadness, and I
could with difficulty extract from any of them more than a
very faint sort of a smile. They turned and twisted the
coins in their hands, and compared them among one another,
jabbering and apparently content. The jealous man kept
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_21" id="Pg_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
his head turned away from them determinedly, pretending
not to see what was going on, and, resting his chin on his
hand, he began to sing a weird, melancholy, guttural song,
assuming an air of contempt, especially when the others
chaffed him. Having allowed him to suffer enough, I gave
him two coins instead of one, and with them the satisfaction
of the last grin.</p>

<p>I then tried to photograph them, but my camera was looked upon with
suspicion, and as plate after plate was exposed in portraying single
individuals or groups, they shuddered at each &quot;click&quot; of the
spring.</p>

<p>&quot;The gods will be angry with you for doing <i>that</i>,&quot; said a
Raot, pointing at the camera, &quot;unless you give us a large white
coin.&quot;</p>

<p>I took advantage of this, and promised them as best I could through my
guide &quot;two large coins&quot; if they would take me to their huts,
some few hundred yards below the lofty eyrie in the cliff, but I must for
the sum be allowed not only to see but to touch and have explained to me
anything I liked.</p>

<p>They consented, and we began our descent of the
precipitous track leading to their habitations, a track fit really
only for monkeys. Several women and children, who had
come up attracted by the sight of strangers, joined with the
men in giving us a helping hand, and in fact, I believe there
cannot have been a single paw in the company that did not
at one time or other during the descent clutch some portion
of my clothing in the friendliest spirit. Holding on to one
another, we proceeded in a body, not always at a pleasant
pace, down the dangerous cliff. Two or three times one of
the natives or myself tripped and almost dragged the remainder
of the party over the precipice, while the piercing
yells and screams of the women seemed to echo back for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_22" id="Pg_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>
miles around. I was not sorry when we at last reached
the small huts by the river which made up their village.</p></div>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The habitations were squalid beyond measure. Constructed
with a rough frame of tree-branches, fortified by
wooden posts and rafters, roofed over with a thatch of dried
grass, the majority of them measured about ten feet. They
were built against the hillside, a strong bi-forked pole in the
centre of the structure supporting the roof, and were usually
divided into two sections, so as to give shelter each of them
to two families. They contained no furniture, and but few
utensils of the most primitive make. There were circular
wooden bowls scooped out in the past by means of sharp-edged
stones, and more recently by cheap blades, which
were of Indian manufacture. For such cultivation as they
were capable of these people used primitive earth rakes,
and they also possessed coarse mallets, sticks, and net bags
in which they kept their stores. Their staple food in former
days was river fish, flesh of wild animals, and roots of certain
trees; but they now eat grain also, and, like all savages,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_23" id="Pg_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
they have a craving for liquor. The interior of Raot
habitations was so primitive and lacking of furniture, that
it hardly requires to be described, and the odours that
emanated from these huts are also better left to the imagination
of the reader.</p>

<p>Entering one of the dwellings, I found squatted round a
fire of wood some women and men, the women wearing
silver bangles and glass bead necklaces, the men very
little more than string earrings. Only one of the men
had on as much as a diminutive loin-cloth, and the women
had scanty dresses of Indian manufacture, obtained in
Askote.</p>

<p>Scanning their features carefully, it struck me that in their
facial lines many points could be traced which would make
one feel inclined to attribute to them a remote Mongolian
origin, modified largely by the climate, the nature of the
country, and probably by intermarriage. In the scale of
standard human races the Raots stood extremely low, as
can be judged from the accompanying photographs. The
women, as will be seen, had abnormally small skulls
with low foreheads, and although they looked devoid
even of a glint of reason, they were actually fairly intelligent.
They had high cheek-bones; long, flattish noses,
broad and rounded as in the Mongolian type. The chin
was in most instances round, very receding, though the lips
were in their normal position, thin, and very tightly closed
with up-turned corners to the mouth. The lower jaw was
extremely short and narrow, whereas the upper one seemed
quite out of proportion to the size of the skull. Their ears
were large, outstanding, and unmodelled, but capable of
catching sounds at great distances.</p>

<p>The men had better heads than the women, underdeveloped
yet comparatively well balanced. They had
higher and broader foreheads, similar though shorter noses,
chins not quite so receding, the whole lower jaw extraordinarily
narrow, but the upper lip, as with the women,
huge and out of all proportion.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Raots are not a pure race, and even
among the few I came across variations so considerable
occurred as to puzzle one in tracing their origin. They
invariably possess luxuriant coal-black hair, which never
attains more than a moderate length. It is not coarse in
texture, but is usually so dirty that it appears coarser than it
really is. They have very little hair on their bodies except
in the arm-pits, and their moustaches and beards hardly
deserve the name.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_24" id="Pg_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
The men generally part the crop on their head in the middle, so that it
flows on either side of the skull, just covering the ears, and I found
the same strange custom that I observed years ago among the Ainu of Yezo
of shaving a lozenge-shaped portion of the scalp in the centre of the
forehead directly above the nose. The women, using their fingers as a
comb, draw their hair to the back of the head and tie it in a knot.</p>

<p>The bodies of the better specimens I saw were slight and agile, with no
superfluous fat or flesh. Supple to a degree, yet solid and muscular,
with well-proportioned limbs and a skin of a rich tinge between bronze
and terra-cotta colour, these savages, dirty and unclothed as they were,
certainly appealed to the artistic side of my temperament, particularly
on account of their very majestic deportment. I noticed their regular
breathing, which they usually did through the nose, keeping their mouths
tightly closed, and also one very curious peculiarity about their feet,
viz., the length of the second toe, protruding considerably beyond the
others, and giving them no doubt the power of using their toes almost as
we should our fingers. The palms of their hands were almost without
lines, the finger-nails flat, and their thumbs stumpy with the last
phalange curiously short.</p>

<p>If the Raots to-day have adopted some articles of clothing
and ornament, besides altering their diet to a certain extent,
it is due entirely to the Rajiwar of Askote, who, taking a
great interest in the tribes he rules over, provides them in a
patriarchal way with all sorts of necessaries of life. Very
few Raots have of late years visited Askote, as they are of a
retiring nature and seem contented with their primitive
abodes in the forests of Chipula, which they claim as their
own. Their only occupations are fishing and hunting, and
they are said to have a predilection for the flesh of the
larger Himahlyan monkey, although from my own observation
I should have said that they would eat almost anything
they could get. It has generally been assumed that the Raot
women are kept in strict seclusion and hidden from strangers,
and I cannot better prove the absurdity of this than by reproducing
in these pages one of several photographs of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_25" id="Pg_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
Raot women, for which they posed at my request without
the slightest objection from the men. They are generally
believed to be chaste, and my photographs prove, I think,
that whatever charm they may possess for the Raot men,
their peculiar beauty offers but little temptation to others.</p>

<p>They are rapidly diminishing in numbers, chiefly no doubt
on account of constant intermarriage. I was assured that
the women are not sterile, but that there is enormous
mortality among the young children. They bury their dead,
and for several days afterwards offer food and water to the
spirit of the departed.</p>

<p>I was unable to ascertain what their marriage ceremonies
were like, or if they had any to speak of, but it appeared that
there was a considerable family feeling among couples living
maritally together. They are superstitious and hold in
curious awe the spirits of the mountains, the sun, the moon,
fire, water, and wind. Whether this amounts to a definite
form of worship I cannot say: I certainly saw no signs of the
offering of prayers or sacrifices.</p>

<p>The Raots claim to be the descendants of kings, and they
refuse allegiance to any one. They will neither salute you
nor bow to you.</p>

<p>&quot;It is for other people to salute us. Our blood is the
blood of kings, and though for choice we have for centuries
retired to the jungle, we are none the less the sons of
kings.&quot;</p></div>

<p>After a while, and when I had spent some considerable
time among them, these royal savages seemed uncomfortable
and apprehensive. I had turned over, examined, drawn or
photographed every household article I had seen, had
measured every one, male and female, who consented to
be measured, and paid them the stipulated money. As
I was about to leave, the grey-haired man approached me
again.</p>

<p>&quot;You have seen the home of the Raots. You are the
first stranger who has done so, and you will suffer much.
The gods are very angry with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; rejoined another savage, pointing at the ravine,
&quot;whoever treads along that track and is not a Raot will be
afflicted by a great calamity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Kush paruani, Sahib&quot;</i> (&quot;Never mind, sir&quot;), interrupted
the guide, &quot;they are only barbarians, they know no better.
I have myself never been here, so I suppose I shall also
come in for my share.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You too will suffer,&quot; said the old Raot, with self-assurance.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_26" id="Pg_26"></a>[<a href="./images/26.png">26</a>]</span>
The Raots stood round me silently as I packed up the
camera, and I felt that they looked upon me as a man whose
fate was settled. They did not acknowledge my farewell,
and, had I been in the least superstitious, might have made
me thoroughly uncomfortable with their solemn, stolid
gravity.</p>

<h5>A pilgrim from Mansarowar Lake&mdash;The spirits of the mountains&mdash;A
safeguard against them&mdash;Tibetan encampments&mdash;The
Rajiwar&mdash;A waterfall&mdash;Watermills.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> returned to Askote from my excursion, I saw while going round the
town with Jagat Sing, in a low stone shed by the side of the palace, the
tall gaunt figure of a man emerging from a cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Who is that?&quot; I inquired of my companion.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that is a fakir returning from a pilgrimage to the sacred lake
of Mansarowar in Tibet. Many of these fanatics pass through here during
the summer on their religious journeys.&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter">The Rajiwar of Askote, his Brother and Son</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>My curiosity drew me towards the weird individual. He
was over six feet in height, and his slim body had been
covered with ashes, giving the dark skin a tinge of ghastly
grey. I asked him to come out into the light. His masses
of long hair had been plaited into small tresses which were
wound round his head in the fashion of a turban&mdash;the
&quot;<i>Tatta</i>.&quot; The hair, too, had been whitened, while the long
thin beard had been dyed bright red. His eyes were sunken
and, apparently to add to the ghastly and decidedly repulsive
effect, his forehead and cheeks were plastered with a thick
white paint. He seemed half stupefied, and had very little
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_28" id="Pg_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>
to say for himself. As can be seen by the illustration,
he was scantily clothed, but he wore the <i>Kamarjuri</i> or
fakir's chain about his loins, and he had a bead bracelet
round his arm above the elbow. His waist was encircled
with a belt of wooden beads, and a necklace of plaited hair
ornamented his neck. He spent his days rolling himself in
ashes and enduring self-imposed bodily privations, with a
view to attain a state of sanctification.</p>

<p>Rumours had reached me of some curious superstitions
prevalent among these mountain folk.</p>

<p>&quot;Tell me,&quot; I said to Jagat Sing, &quot;are there 'spirits of the
mountain' in these ranges? And do the people really
believe in them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied the young fellow, &quot;there certainly are
a number of them, and they are often very troublesome,
especially to certain people. They are seldom known, however,
to kill any one.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Then they are not quite so bad as some human beings,&quot;
I replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, sir, they are very bad. They seize sleeping people
by the throat with claws like iron, sitting on the chests of
their victims.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_29" id="Pg_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
&quot;Does not that sound more like an attack of indigestion?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir. The ghosts of the mountains are the spirits of
people that have not gone to heaven. They are to be found
in swarms at night in the forest. The people are terrified of
them. They haunt the mountain-tops and slopes, and they
can assume the semblance of a cat, a mouse, or any other
animal; in fact they are said to frequently change their
appearance. Where no man can tread, among rocks and precipices,
or in the thick jungle, the spirits seek their retreat,
but often they abandon their haunts to seek for men. The
person who becomes possessed generally remains in a semi-conscious
condition and ejaculates mad cries and unintelligible
words. There are men who profess to know charms
to draw them out. Some remedies are for that purpose
commonly used by the natives with more or less success.
A grass called <i>Bichna</i> (nettles) has the faculty of frightening
the spirits away when applied on the body of the sufferer,
but the most effective remedy is to make pretence to beat
with a red-hot iron the person possessed. The spirits seem
to fear that more than anything else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do the spirits ever speak?&quot; I inquired, interested in the
curious superstitions of these hill men.</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir, not often, nor usually directly, but they do it
through people who are possessed by them. It is they who
tell many strange tales of the spirits. One curious point
about them is that they only seize people who are afraid of
them. If defied they vanish.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do the natives adopt any special method to protect themselves
from these mountain demons?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Fire is the only sure protection. Any one sleeping near
a fire is safe, and as long as there is a flame blazing the
spirits keep away.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Do you know any one who has seen them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. A chaprassi called Joga tells of having been compelled
to travel at night through a forest: he heard a voice
calling him by name. Terrified, he stopped, and for some
moments his voice failed him. At last, trembling all over,
he replied, and instantly a swarm of spirits appeared and
challenged him to do them harm. Joga ran for his life and
the demons vanished. Spirits have been known to throw
stones at passers-by.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Have you ever seen a spirit, Jagat Sing?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Only once. I was returning to the palace late in the
evening when up the steep road I perceived a woman's
figure. It was a beautiful moonlight night. I walked up,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_30" id="Pg_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
and as I passed, the face of the strange being appeared
black, inhuman and ghastly. I staggered when I saw the
weird apparition approach, my blood ran cold with fear. I
struck a mighty blow with my stick, but behold! the cane
whirled through the air and hit nothing. Instantly the
ghost vanished.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I wish, Jagat Sing, that you could show me some of
these spirits; I would give anything to make a sketch of
them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You cannot always see them when you want, sir, but
they are always to be avoided. They are evil spirits and can
do nothing but harm.&quot;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Leaving Askote (4600 feet) by the winding road through
a dense forest, I crossed by a suspension bridge the Gori
River at Gargia (2450 feet). The track was along the low and
unpleasantly hot valley of the Kali River, a raging stream
flowing with indescribable rapidity in the opposite direction
to that in which I was travelling. It formed the boundary
line between Nepal and Kumaon. Huts and patches of cultivation
were to be seen on the Nepalese side, whereas on our
side we came upon deserted and roofless winter dwellings
of Shokas (usually but not correctly called Botiyas) and
Tibetans, who migrate to these warmer regions to graze their
sheep during the colder months of the year. The Shoka
summer residences are at greater elevations, mostly along
the highways to Tibet and nearer the Tibetan boundary.
On arriving at the Kutzia Daramsalla, a messenger brought
me the news that the Rajiwar, whom I had missed seeing at
Askote, was now here for the purpose of making offerings to
certain deities. He would call upon me at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, so, having
some time to spare, I went to bathe in the deliciously cold
though, as I found, dangerously rapid stream. Swimming was
out of the question, and even an immersion bath was attended
with a certain amount of risk. The current caused me to lose
my footing, and I soon found myself washed with great force
against some rocks thirty or forty yards down stream. I
came out of the water <i>minus</i> a few patches of skin on my
knees and shins, and while drying myself in the sun, received
a deputation of the <i>Patan</i> (head village man) and other
natives, conveying with their most respectful salaams gifts of
milk, <i>kielas</i> (bananas), <i>kakri</i> (gigantic cucumbers), and nuts.
These hill fellows impressed me as being of a far superior
standard to the Hindoos of the plains. They were lightly
yet strongly built, and showed evidence of both character
and dignity. With their fair complexion and luxuriant black
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_31" id="Pg_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
hair and moustache they resembled Spaniards or Southern
Italians. They lacked entirely the affected manner and falseness
of speech and demeanour, so common among the
natives who are constantly in contact with Europeans.</p>

<p>Below the Daramsalla, near the water-side, was a large
Tibetan encampment of some twenty or thirty tents which
had all originally been white, but were now black with smoke.
In these were men, women, and children, with all their paraphernalia;
and the first thing that attracted my eye in each
tent was the quantity of shiny brass bowls strewn upon the
ground, the entire energy of the tent-owners seemingly
being spent in keeping these utensils clean and bright, to the
utter neglect of their other property. Walls of sheep-loads
were erected either inside the tent or directly outside, covered
in the latter case with cloths in order to protect them from
the rain.</p>

<p>Punctually at 3 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Rajiwar arrived, carried in a
<i>dandy</i>, and followed by his brother, who sat in a mountain
dandy. The Rajiwar's son and heir rode a splendid grey
pony. I went to assist the old Rajiwar to alight, as for some
years he had been paralysed. We shook hands heartily, and
I led him into the Daramsalla (2875 feet), where in default of
furniture we all sat on packing-cases. His refined, well-cut
features, his attractive manner, and the soft, dignified voice
in which he spoke clearly indicated a man of superior blood
and uncommon ability. His modesty and simplicity were
delightful.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope that your health is good and that you have not
suffered too much on your journey. I was grieved not to
be in Askote to receive you. Are your dear parents alive?
Have you any brothers and sisters? Are you married? I
would much like to visit England. It must be a wonderful
country, and so much do I admire it that I have given
my nephews a British education, and one of them is now
serving the Maharanee (Queen) Victoria as Political
Peshkar.&quot;</p>

<p>I answered his questions as best I could with the aid
of a Hindustani dictionary, expressive gestures, and quick
sketches. He spoke of many of our latest inventions with
marked interest and intelligence.</p>

<p>He seemed greatly struck with my scientific instruments,
but he and his people were more particularly attracted by
my rifles, revolvers, and other weapons, especially the
256&deg; Mannlicher, sighted to 1000 yards.</p>

<p>The Rajiwar pressed me to return with him to Askote,
where he offered to give me tiger, bear, and leopard shoot<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_32" id="Pg_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>ing.
Tempting as the invitation was, I could not accept it,
for my plans would lead me in the opposite direction. His
visit lasted for more than three hours; and I was pleased to
feel that we parted great friends.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>On the road to Dharchula, along the low-lying valley, the
heat was unbearable, although the sun was near the horizon.
We came upon a waterfall falling from a great height over a
series of umbrella-like stalactites covered with moss. The
last rays of the sun shone on the dropping water, brilliant
and sparkling as a shower of diamonds. Several small rainbows
added to the beauty of the scene. I rested some time
in this cool and beautiful retreat. There were birds singing
and monkeys playing among the trees. Farther on, where
the river bends, there are two large caves hollowed in the
rock; the smoke-blackened ceilings prove that these are
used as camping grounds by travelling Shokas and Hunyas
(Tibetans). Large black-faced, white-bearded monkeys
swarmed everywhere, frankly and gladly mischievous.
They throw or roll stones down upon the passers-by, often
causing accidents, the track being rather narrow and sheer
above the river.</p>

<p>Previous to arriving at the spot where the Tsuagar flows
into the Kali River one meets with many Tibetan, Humli
and Rongba encampments.</p>

<p>I camped at Kalika (3205 feet) by the side of a gigantic
tree with boughs spreading well over the road, the cha<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_33" id="Pg_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>prassis
and men erecting a comfortable <i>ch&ouml;pper</i> of mats,
foliage, and branches.</p>

<p>I was anxious to get through the hot valley with the
greatest possible speed, so, notwithstanding that we had
halted very late at night, I roused my men at 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and
again set forth on the march. Here and there along the
road we passed deserted winter dwellings of Shokas, nearly
all with broken thatched roofs. Some, however, were roofed
with slate, the distinctive mark of residence of the Darma
Shokas.</p>

<p>The primitive Shoka water-mills were curious. By a very
ingenious contrivance the water of a stream propelled a
heavy cylindrical stone revolving on the top of another.
The grain fell slowly from a magazine above into a hole
pierced in the centre of the upper wheel, and finding its way
through a channel between the two cylinders, was ground
into fine flour.</p>

<p>Dharchula (3550 <i>feet</i>) the largest Shoka winter settlement,
is situated on a fine stretch of flat land some hundred feet
above the river; the village consists of twelve long rows of
roofless houses very similar in size and shape. Four larger
buildings at the extreme limit of the settlement attract
notice. One of these is a Daramsalla. The others, two
high stone buildings, are a school, hospital and dispensary
belonging to the Methodist Episcopal Mission and under
the careful supervision of Miss Sheldon, M.D., Miss Brown,
and that wonderful pioneer, Dr. H. Wilson. A bungalow
of the same mission is built higher up on the hillside.</p>

<p>Between the two spots where from Nepal the Lachu and
the Shakta join the Kali, was Dubart (3700 feet), and from
thence one gradually rose to 4120 feet at the Relegar River,
also a tributary of the larger stream. Having crossed the Rankuti
River I ascended still higher by zigzag walking, slowly
leaving behind me range after range of mountains beyond
the valley of the river; while on the Nepal side, beyond the
three nearer ranges, snow peaks of great height and beauty
stood out against the sky-line. The highest point on the
road was 5450 feet, after which we descended to 5275 feet
at Khela Daramsalla, which we did not reach till late at
night.</p>

<p>Near Khela on the top of a high mountain stood a tall
quadrangular rock not unlike a tower. The natives say that
a mere touch causes it to shake and revolve, but this belief
is not general, for others deny that it ever moves. I could
not spare the time to go and test the facts, nor could I
obtain reliable information from any one who had had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_34" id="Pg_34"></a>[<a href="./images/34.png">34</a>]</span>
actual experience. So far as I could see with the aid of my
telescope, the rock seemed to be standing firmly on a very
solid base. To my regret also, I was unable to visit the
curious hot sulphur springs on the Darma Ganga, and the
strange cave in which much animal life is lost owing to the
noxious gases rising from the ground. I gathered from
various reports that this cave or grotto is packed with
skeletons of birds and quadrupeds who have unknowingly
entered this chamber of death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> are two principal highways from Khela to Hundes:

<hr class="short" />

<p>The trade route <i>vi&acirc;</i> Darma is less frequented than the one
by the Lippu, but it is nevertheless of considerable importance,
inasmuch as a certain portion of the trade of South-west
Tibet with India is carried on through the medium of
the Darma Shokas. It consists mainly of borax, salt, wool,
skins, cloth, and utensils, in exchange for which the Tibetans
take silver, wheat, rice, <i>satoo</i>, <i>ghur</i>, lump candied sugar,
pepper, beads of all kinds, and articles of Indian manufacture.
For a mountain track, and considering the altitudes
to which it rises, the Darma way is comparatively good and
safe, notwithstanding that in following upwards the course
of the Dholi River the narrow path in many places overhangs
deep ravines and precipices. There are many Shoka
villages and settlements on the banks of the stream, the most
important ones being the Nyu, Sobala, Sela, Nagling (9520
feet), Bahling (10,230 feet), Sona and Tuktung (10,630 feet),
Dansu and Yansu, where there is a bridge. On the north-east
bank is Goa, facing Dakar, and farther up, at an elevation
of 10,400 feet, the Lissar, a rapid tributary with muddy
water.</p>

<p>The Dholi springs from a series of comparatively small
glaciers north-east of a range forming a branch of the higher
Himahlyan chain, and extending in a south-easterly direction
as far as the point where the two streams meet. It receives,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_36" id="Pg_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span>
on its precipitous descent, many small snow-fed tributaries,
those from the Katz snowfields and the Nui glacier being
the most important. Its way lies in a tortuous channel
amidst rocks and ravines, first tending towards the South-East,
then due South, and last South-West down to the point
where it is joined by the Lissar, coming from the North-West
along a line almost parallel on the opposite watershed of
the range.</p>

<p>Tyang, Sipu (11,400 feet), and Marcha (10,890 feet), are the
three most important Shoka villages on the Lissar.</p>

<p>From Marcha there is a track connecting the valleys of
the Lissar and Gori. You ascend the high mountain range
west of the Lissar by skirting the northern edge of the
Nipchung Kang glacier and keeping south of the Kharsa
glacier, and, on a route that is unpopular on account of its
constant difficulties and perils, you pass, as you descend in a
westerly direction, the Tertcha glacier. South of the Shun
Kalpa glacier you reach first Ralem and then Sumdu, which
is situated on a tributary of the Gori River, itself a tributary</p>

of the Kali. The rugged, barren chain of mountains
separating the Gori from the Lissar extends in a general
direction from S.S.E. to N.N.E. up to the Ralfo glacier, and
there turns in a curve North-West among a succession of
perpetual snow-fields and glaciers. The glaciers to the
North-East and East of the range outnumber those on the
West, but there is one of importance called in its different
sections the Kala Baland, the Shun Kalpa, and the Tertcha.
There are, along the fifteen most northerly miles of the range,
south of the point where it joins the Himahlyan chain, other
glaciers of considerable size and importance, but I was not
able to ascertain their names, excepting that of the <i>Lissar
seva</i>, the most northern of all, forming the source of the
Lissar. The inter-Lissar-Gori range is of considerable
geographical importance, not only because it forms the
boundary between the two parts of Bhot called Darma and
Johar, but also because of the magnificent peaks reaching in
the Bambadhura an elevation of 20,760 feet, and in a higher
unnamed peak, South-East of it, 21,470 feet. There are also
the two Kharsa peaks, the one North-West of the glacier
bearing its name being 19,650 feet, the one South-West of it
slightly over 20,900 feet, and S.S.W. one peak 21,360 feet,
another 21,520 feet, and farther still, North of the Telkot
glacier, the highest of all, 22,660 feet. In a South-East
direction there are peaks 20,700 feet, 20,783 feet, and 21,114
feet high. At the point where the ridge turns South the
elevations become lower, the two highest being 19,923 feet and
19,814 feet, the latter situated at the point where a smaller
range branches off to the South-East, the principal range
running South for the next eleven or twelve miles, with no
very remarkable elevations. In the side range there are
peaks of 18,280 feet, 17,062 feet, 14,960 feet, 14,960 feet
respectively.</p>

<p>In Lat. 29&deg; 59&#8242; 10&#8243; N. and Long. 80&deg; 31&#8242; 45&#8243; E. the range
again separates into two secondary ridges, one extending
South-East, the other South-West, and in turn both these
are again subdivided into minor hill ridges, along which no
summits are found surpassing 13,000 feet, except the Basili,
13,244 feet.</p>

<p>The Bungadhura Mountain (9037 feet), in close proximity
to Khela, terminates the South-Easterly division of the
range, separating the Pargana of Darma from that of Askote.
The actual boundary line, however, does not follow the
higher mountain range as far as the Kali River, but swerves
to the south along the ridge overlooking the valley of the
River Relegar. These mountains are called the Mangthil.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_39" id="Pg_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
There is west of the above ridge a second and even more
important chain, running out parallel to it from the backbone
of the Himahlyan great mountain system. This
second ridge contains the highest mountain in the British
Empire, Nanda Devi (25,660 feet) with its second peak (24,380
feet), also Trisul (23,406 feet), East Trisul (22,360 feet), and
Nanda Kot (22,530 feet). This range and its ramifications
divide the valleys of the Gori River (the Pargana of Johar)
from the most Western portion of Bhot, the Painkhanda
Pargana.</p>

<p>The well-known Milam and Pindari glaciers are one on
the Eastern, the other on the South-West side of this range.
The Milam highway to Tibet, frequented by the Johari
traders, traverses over the Kungribingri Pass (18,300 feet),
and the Uttadhura (17,590 feet) directly S.S.W. of it into
Hundes.</p>

<p>The Pargana Painkhanda, a region equally Alpine,
similarly covered with vast stretches of perpetual snow and
extensive glaciers, is in the North-East corner of Garwhal,
bordering on Tibet, and along the Dhauli River; intersecting
it, another trade route finds its way into Western Tibet by
the Niti Pass. Leaving the course of the Dhauli at Jelam
(10,100 feet), this track proceeds almost due east, rising to an
altitude of 16,600 feet on the Niti, in Lat. 30&deg; 57&#8242; 59&#8243; N. and
Long. 79&deg; 55&#8242; 3&#8243; E., which is, from all accounts, a very easy
pass, and quite free from snow during the summer months.
The people of the Painkhanda Pargana use this pass as well
as the other passes of Malla Shilanch and Tumzun, besides
the Shorhoti, visited by H. R. Strachey some years ago, over
which, however, only a small portion of the trade with
Hundes is carried, for it is considered the most dangerous
of the three. The cold and turbid waters of the Dhauli,
swollen by dozens of equally foaming and muddy tributaries,
become ultimately the sacred waters of the Ganges.</p>

<p>The three Alpine Parganas, viz., the Painkhanda, Johar,
and Darma (Darma, Chaudas, and Bias) are inhabited by
races closely allied and akin to those of Tibet proper. The
region is collectively named Bhot, although that designation
is more particularly applied by the natives of India to that
portion of the country which includes Darma, Bias, and
Chaudas, and which has for natural boundaries the Kali
River to the South-East, separating it from Nepal and the
great Himahlyan chain to the North-East, extending from
the Lissar Peak in a general direction of about 115&deg;.</p>

<p>A ramification leaving the main range at the Darma Pass
stretches across from N.N.W. to S.S.E., separating the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_40" id="Pg_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
above-mentioned Darma Ganga from the Kuti River, along
which I eventually travelled on my way to Tibet. The main
elevations found on this ridge are 18,510 feet on the Darma
Pass; north-east of the Rama glacier a peak 20,760 feet; the
Gurma Mountain 20,320 feet; and others south of them as
high as 20,380 feet, 20,330 feet, 20,260 feet. East of the
latter summit is one 20,455 feet.</p>

<h5>The word <i>Bhot</i> and its meaning&mdash;Tibetan influence&mdash;Tibetan
abuses&mdash;The ever-helpful Chanden Sing&mdash;The first Shoka
village&mdash;Chanden Sing in disgrace&mdash;Weaving-loom&mdash;Fabrics&mdash;All's
well that ends well!</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> name <i>Bhot</i>, pronounced Bod, Pote, T&uuml;p&ouml;t, or Taip&ouml;t,
by which this inter-Alpine region is called, means Tibet.
In fact <i>Tibet</i> is probably merely a corruption of <i>T&uuml;p&ouml;t</i>.
These lofty &quot;pattis&quot; of Darma, Bias, and Chaudas nominally
form part of the British Empire, our geographical boundary
with Nari Khorsum or Hundes (Great Tibet), being the main
Himahlyan chain forming the watershed between the two
countries. In spite of this actual territorial right, I found
at the time of my visit in 1897 that it was impossible not to
agree with the natives in asserting that British prestige and
protection in those regions were mere myths; that Tibetan
influence alone was dominant and prevailing, and Tibetan
law enforced and feared. The natives invariably showed
abject obsequiousness and servile submission to Tibetans,
being at the same time compelled to display actual disrespect
to British officials. They were driven to bring the
greater number of civil and criminal cases before Tibetan
magistrates in preference to having them tried in a British
court.</p>

<p>The Tibetans, in fact, openly claimed possession of the
&quot;pattis&quot; bordering on Nari Khorsum; and the more
obviously to impress our natives with their influence as
superior to British, they came over to hibernate on our
side, and made themselves quite at home in the warmer
valleys and in the larger bazaars. They brought their
families with them, and drove before them thousands and
thousands of sheep to graze on our pasture-lands; they
gradually destroyed our forests in Bias to supply South-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_42" id="Pg_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>Western
Tibet with fuel for the summer months. For
this they not only paid nothing, but our native subjects
had to convey the timber over the high passes without
remuneration. Necessarily such unprincipled task-masters
did not draw the line at extorting from our natives
under any pretence money, food, clothes, and everything
else they could possibly levy. Some were known
to travel yearly as far south as Lucknow, Calcutta, and
Bombay.</p>

<p>So much for the gentleness of the Tibetans&mdash;a hermit
nation living in a closed country!</p>

<p>Chanden Sing, ever anxious to be polite and helpful,
would not hear of my carrying my own sketch and note
books as had always been my custom, but insisted on doing
so himself.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hum pagal neh!</i>&quot; (&quot;I am no fool!&quot;) said he with an
expression of wounded feelings. &quot;I will take great care of
them.&quot;</p>

<p>We started up the steep road, having first descended to
the level of the River Dholi, 800 feet lower than Khela,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_43" id="Pg_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>
crossing by a wooden bridge. The zigzag up the mountain-side
seemed endless. Here and there a cool spring of
crystal water quenched our thirst, welcome indeed on
that tedious ascent in the broiling sun. Six miles above
Khela we had risen to 7120 feet, and from this point the
incline became less trying. Still we rose to 7450 feet two
miles farther on, where under the shade of some magnificent
old trees, at Pungo, I halted for lunch. We had entered the
first inhabited village of the Shokas, visually but erroneously
called Botiyas, and were now in that part of their country
called Chaudas.</p>

<p>A pleasant surprise awaited me. A smart-looking lad in
European clothes came boldly forward, and, stretching out
his hand, shook mine for some considerable time in a jovial
and friendly fashion.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a Christian,&quot; said he.</p>

<p>&quot;I should say that you were by the way you shake
hands.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; he proceeded. &quot;I have prepared for you some
milk, some <i>chapatis</i> (native bread), and some nuts. Please
accept them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; I said. &quot;You do not seem to be a bad
Christian. What is your name?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Master G. B. Walter, sir. I teach in the school.&quot;</p>

<p>A crowd of Shokas had collected. Their first shyness
having worn off, they proved to be polite and kind. The
<i>na&iuml;ve</i> nature and graceful manner of the Shoka girls
struck me particularly on this my first introduction to
them. Much less shy than the men, they came forward,
and joked and laughed as if they had known me all
their lives. I wished to sketch two or three of the more
attractive.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is my book, Chanden Sing?&quot; I inquired of my
bearer.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hazur hum mallum neh!</i>&quot; (&quot;I do not know, sir!&quot;)
was his melancholy answer as he searched his empty
pockets.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah! you villain! Is that the care you take of my notes
and sketches? What have you done with them?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh Sahib, I drank some water at the Dholi River. I had
the book then in my hand. I must have left it on a stone
when I stooped to drink water from the stream,&quot; the
wretched man explained.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to say that Chanden Sing was
promptly despatched to the spot he had named, with strict
orders not to appear before me again without the book.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_44" id="Pg_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
I spent two or three pleasant hours in having the primitive
Shoka weaving-looms, the processes of spinning and cloth
manufacture, explained to me. As can be seen from the
illustration on <a href="#Pg_42">p. 42</a>, the weaving looms of the Shokas are in
every way similar to those used by the Tibetans proper, and
are quite simple in construction. The warp is kept at great
tension, and the cloth-beam on which the woven tissue is
rolled rests on the woman's lap during the process of weaving.
There are no treadles in the Shoka loom, by which the two
sets of warp threads are alternately raised or depressed
between each time that the transverse thread is passed, and
all work is done by hand. The transverse thread is beaten
firmly home by means of a heavy prismatic piece of wood.
The material used in weaving is yak or sheep's wool, either
in its natural colour or dyed in the primary colours of red
and blue and yellow, and one secondary only, green.
Blue and red are used in the greater and equal proportion;
then green. Yellow is very parsimoniously used.
The thread is well twisted and is subjected to no preparation
before spinning, leaving thus a certain greasiness
in the closely-woven material that renders it waterproof.
In weaving colour fabrics several shuttles are used.</p>

<p>Shoka women are very adept at this ancient art, and they
patiently sit out of doors day after day weaving most intricate
and artistic patterns. These coloured tissues, if we
except the simpler ones with blue ground and lines for
women's garments, are usually very narrow (about seven
inches in width), whereas the less elaborate ones, such as
the white material of which men's clothes are made, average
sixteen inches.</p>

<p>The patterns in these many-coloured materials are woven
from memory, and do not contain curves or circles, but are
entirely composed of lines and angles, combinations of
small lozenges and squares separated by long tri-coloured
parallel lines, forming, so far as weaving is concerned, the
main Shoka ideas of decoration and ornament. The fabrics
are extraordinarily strong. The narrow coloured cloth of
better quality is used mostly for making bags in which
money and food are carried; the coarser kind for the
double sheep-loads.</p>

<p>The more talented of the Shoka young women show much
ingenuity in carpet or rather rug making. They have copied
the idea from old Chinese rugs which have found their way
here <i>vi&acirc;</i> Lhassa, and though upon close examination it is
true they differ considerably in quality and manufacture,
they are pleasing enough to the eye. These rugs are woven
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_45" id="Pg_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
upon coarse thread matting, the coloured material being let
in vertically. A soft surface is obtained not unlike in
general appearance to that of Persian carpets, but not quite
so pleasant to the touch. These small rectangular rugs are
offered in the house of Shoka gentlemen to guests to sit
on, and are also used to render the Tibetan saddles less
uncomfortable.</p>

<p>As time went on I became very anxious as to the missing
book, for it contained all my notes of the journey. The
thought of its being deposited on a rock washed by a rapid
stream into which it might easily slip and be carried away
kept me in a state of suspense. At last a staggering figure
approached; it was Chanden Sing waving the book
triumphantly in the air. He had run the distance of many
miles down to the river and back so quickly that when he
reached me he was utterly exhausted. He handed me the
book, and once more we started, followed by Walter and
the whole community, down the steep incline to the river.
At this place some of the Shokas seized my hands and
placed them on their foreheads, at the same time making
deep bows. Others embraced my feet, while the women
folks bade me the usual Hindustani &quot;<i>Acha giao</i>&quot; (&quot;Go
well&quot;).</p>

<p>After some time had been wasted, or at least spent, in
receiving these odd salutations, I persuaded them to retrace
their steps, and they left me.</p>

Shrine and Flying Prayers</div>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> reach Shosha I had to climb a further three miles, which proved almost
as steep as the previous ascent to Pungo.</p>

<p>A curious custom of praying by wind-power, probably borrowed from the
Tibetans, prevails among the Shokas. The Tibetans, with a more intense
religion than the Shokas, use for this purpose not only the wind but even
water to propel their praying machines. Let me explain these simple
mechanical contrivances for prayers. One or more rags or
pieces of cloth, usually white, but on occasions red or blue,
are fastened and hung by one end to a string stretched
across a road, a pass, or a path. On crossing a pass for the
first time Shokas invariably cut a strip of cloth and place it
so that it will flap in the breeze. Also when materials for a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_47" id="Pg_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
new dress are purchased or manufactured, it is customary
for them to tear off a narrow strip of the stuff and make a
flying prayer of it. As long as there is motion in it there is
prayer, so that the natives tie them very fast to sticks, poles,
or branches of trees; and certain shrubs and trees in weird
romantic spots on the mountains are covered with these
religious signs. Moreover, on the top of nearly every Shoka
dwelling a vast number of similar little flags can be seen, as
well as near their shrines and at the outer gates of a
village.</p>

<p>I put up at the Titela Daramsalla, one mile above Shosha
village. The weather had been threatening for several days,
and a steady downpour came upon us during the evening.
Work had been accumulating daily. I decided to develop
the large number of plates I had taken on my journey, a
job hateful beyond measure when you are on the move.
Having duly unpacked all the developing dishes and prepared
the different solutions, I set to work to make the
shelter completely dark. The next important item required
was water, and of this there was plenty in that wretched
shanty! I had just developed half-a-dozen negatives, and
was delighted at the excellent results, when, in consequence
of the storm having grown more violent, the rain began
dripping on my head through the leaky roof of the Daramsalla.
To move all the trays of developers, baths, and fixing
solution would have been a nuisance; besides, I was too
interested in my work to be put out by such small trifles, so
I patiently stood this new discomfort. I shifted my position
continually, merely with the result that the rain dripped
alternately on my back, my legs, or my shoulders, according
to my position. It fell in torrents, and the roof over me
was so leaky that I might as well have been out in the open.
I was sitting in a pool of water and could not lay my hands
upon anything that was not drenched. Fortunately my
boxes and cases were water-tight, or all the instruments and
plates would have been damaged.</p></div>

<p>Annoying as it was, I had to give up work. The best
thing to do was to go to sleep. Easier said than done. My
bedding and blanket were soaked. The attempts to lie
under a waterproof sheet failed, for I felt suffocated, so I
passed the cover to my servant, who, rolling himself in it,
was soon in the arms of Morpheus. Tired and disgusted, I
crouched myself up and eventually fell asleep. I woke up
in the morning with a biting pain in my toes. I had been
lying face downwards, and had involuntarily stretched my
legs during the night. I discovered to my horror that one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_48" id="Pg_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
foot rested in the developing bath and the other in the
fixing solution, which I had forgotten to empty out of the
large celluloid trays.</p>

<p>The morning was spent in drying up things in the sun,
including our clothes, while we, clad in a &quot;<i>doti</i>&quot; (large loin-cloth
as used by the natives of India), squatted down in the
warmth in order to restore our saturated skins to their natural
condition.</p>

<p>I was in the meantime interviewed by many Shokas,
applying for medicines, and wishing to sell their native
wares.</p>

<p>A pretty girl, from whom I bought a curious set of neck
hangings made of musk-deer teeth, wished to be cured of the
<i>go&icirc;tre</i>, a complaint too common, alas! on these hills. Then
a child was brought with a nasty tumour in a state of suppuration
inside his left ear. Others wished to be cured of
pains in the stomach and liver, which are very general
among them owing to their abuse of liquor.</p>

<p>Upon hearing that two lady missionaries lived a mile and a
half farther on, at Sirka, I gave myself the pleasure of calling
upon them. They possessed a nice bungalow at an elevation
of 8900 feet above sea level, by the side of which was another
structure for the accommodation of converts and servants.
Lower on the hillside they had built a dispensary and
hospital.</p>

<p>I was received with the utmost courtesy by Miss Sheldon, M.D., and Miss
Brown, of the Methodist Episcopal Mission. I have in my lifetime met with
many missionaries of all creeds in nearly every part of the globe, but
never has it been my luck before to meet two such charming, open-minded,
and really hard-working ladies as the two who now so kindly received me.</p>

<p>&quot;Come right in, Mr. Landor,&quot; said Miss Sheldon with her
delightful American accent, and she shook hands with me in a good, hearty
fashion.</p>

<p>The natives had praised to me the charity and helpfulness of this lady. I
found this more than justified. By night or day she would never refuse
help to the sick, and her deeds of kindness which became
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_49" id="Pg_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
known to me are far too numerous to detail in these pages. Perhaps
her most valuable quality is her perfect tact&mdash;a quality I have
found none too common among missionaries. Her patience, her kindly manner
towards the Shokas, her good heart, the wonderful cures she wrought among
the sick, were items of which these honest mountaineers had everlasting
praises to sing. A Shoka was telling me that it was not an uncommon thing
for Miss Sheldon to give away all her own food supplies, and even the
clothes from her back&mdash;courting for herself discomfort, yet happy in
her good work.</p>

<p>With it was combined a charming modesty. No word about herself or her
actions ever passed her lips. A pioneer in these parts, she evidently
must have encountered much difficulty in the beginning. At present her
good influence over the Shokas is very considerable. The same can be said
of Miss Brown, who was in every way a worthy comrade of Miss Sheldon.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Lal Sing Tokudar and his Brother</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>They have both in a comparatively short time become
fully acquainted with the Shoka language, and can converse
in it as fluently as in English, this fact alone endearing them
greatly to the natives.</p>

<p>They were kind enough to ask me to dinner. &quot;It is
Sunday,&quot; said Miss Sheldon, &quot;and we shall have all our
Christians dining with us. You will not mind, I am sure.&quot;</p>

<p>I assured her that nothing would interest me more.</p>

<p>I arrived punctually at the hour appointed, and on the
verandah of the bungalow were laid some nice clean mats
upon which we all sat cross-legged in native fashion. We
three Europeans were provided with knife and fork, but all
the natives helped themselves with their fingers, which they
used with much dexterity. There were among the converts
some Hindoos, some Shokas, some Humlis, and a Tibetan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_50" id="Pg_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
woman. All counted, I suppose they were about twenty,
and it would be impossible to find a better behaved set of
Christians anywhere. They ate heartily and only spoke
when they were spoken to.</p>

<p>&quot;I doubt whether I have ever dined with so many good
Christians,&quot; said I jokingly to Miss Sheldon. &quot;It is delightful.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They would much like to hear some of the experiences
of your travels if you would be kind enough to tell them.
That is to say, if you are not too tired and do not mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Interpreted by Miss Brown, I related some of my
adventures in the country of the Ainu. Rarely have I had
such an interested audience. When the story ended they
all salaamed me, and an old veteran Gourkha, one of the
converts, took my hand and shook it warmly.</p>

<p>&quot;You must not mind, Mr. Landor: you see, we treat our
Christians like ourselves,&quot;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> quickly interrupted Miss Sheldon.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, I do not mind,&quot; I replied. &quot;On the contrary, I
am glad to see it done.&quot;</p>

<p>I took my leave and asked the ladies to come to tea with
me the next day. The afternoon came and they arrived,
when to my horror it flashed across my mind that I had
neither cups, nor saucers, nor spoons. I had some tea, but
I had no idea in which box it was, and to save my life I
could not lay my hands upon it. This caused a frank and
delightful remark on the part of Miss Sheldon to Miss
Brown.</p>

<p>&quot;Does not Mr. Landor remind you of 'that other'
eccentric gentleman that came through here last year?&quot;</p>

<p>The moment she had uttered the words Miss Sheldon
saw what she had said, and we all laughed heartily.</p>

<p>&quot;You know, Mr. Landor,&quot; put in Miss Brown, &quot;we half
foresaw that you would not be provided with these
articles of luxury, and we brought our own cups and
saucers.&quot;</p>

<p>The news was a great relief to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Well now, let me persuade you to take some delicious
chocolate instead of tea.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, we would prefer it. We have not had
chocolate for a long time.&quot;</p>

<p>A solid block of chocolate was produced weighing
twenty-eight pounds, and Chanden Sing set to chip off bits
with a stone&mdash;a primitive but effective method. In the</p>

circumstances on pack-saddle cases.</p>

<p>The tea party went off well, for the ladies, evidently suspecting
the &quot;eccentricity&quot; of their host, had come provided
not only with cups and saucers, but with spoons, cake,
bread, butter, and biscuits!</p>

<h5>Discouraging reports&mdash;A steep ascent&mdash;How I came to deserve
the name of &quot;monkey&quot;&mdash;Hard at work&mdash;Promoted in rank&mdash;Collapse
in a gale of wind&mdash;Time and labour lost.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> weather again became rainy and cold. The reports
that I received of the state of the roads farther up were not
encouraging.</p>

<p>&quot;The track is impassable,&quot; said an old Shoka who had
just arrived from Garbyang. &quot;The Lippu Pass by which
you wish to enter Tibet is still closed, and there is much
snow on it still. Then the Jong Pen of Taklakot in Tibet,
having been left unpunished for his last years' attack on
Lieutenant Gaussen, has now a strong guard of three hundred
men to prevent foreigners entering the country. The
<i>Dakus</i> (brigands) infesting the region of the Mansarowar
Lake seem to be more numerous this year than ever.&quot;</p>

<p>I shall come in for a lively time, I thought to myself.</p>

<p>My next camp was at Shankula, 7450 feet above the sea
level. It was reached by going over a delightfully cool track,
not unlike a shady path through a picturesque park, among
tall cedars of Lebanon, beeches and maples, with here and
there a stream or spring of water, and hundreds of black-faced,
white-bearded monkeys playing and leaping from tree
to tree.</p>

<p>I encamped by the river. The day was glorious. In front
of me, north-east by east, stood, gigantic and majestic, some
high snowy peaks. The valley was narrow, and the remainder
of the snowy range of mountains was hidden from sight.
What a lovely subject for a picture! I was tempted to halt and
get out my paint-box and sketch-book; and abandoning my
lunch, which was being cooked, I climbed to the summit of
a high peak in order to obtain a more extensive view. The
ascent, first on slippery grass, then over slaty rocks, was by
no means easy, nor devoid of a certain amount of danger;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_54" id="Pg_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
but so keen was I to get to the top that I reached the summit
very quickly, leaving half-way down the mountain slope the
two men who had followed me. In places near the top
there were rocks to climb that stood almost perpendicular,
and it was necessary to use hands as well as feet. It was
not unlike climbing up a rough wall. I was nevertheless
well repaid for my trouble. The view from that high
point of vantage was magnificent, and I confess that I
felt almost too ambitious when, having unslung my
paint-box, I attempted to reproduce on paper the scene
before me.</p>

<p>&quot;I am a fool,&quot; said I to myself, &quot;to try and paint that!
What painter could do those mountains justice?&quot;</p>

<p>I dashed off the picture as usual very hastily, but never
was a rash venture rewarded with poorer result, and those
eternal giants remained unpainted.</p>

<p>Disconsolate, I made my way down. It was more difficult
even than the climb up. A false step, a slip, and it might
have cost my life, especially along the steep precipice, where
I had to cling to anything projecting in the wall-like rock.
I had gone four thousand feet higher than the camp, reaching
an elevation of 11,450 feet above sea level.</p>

<p>It was this performance, watched anxiously from my camp
down below, as well as by the army of men belonging to the
Deputy Commissioner of Almora, who was also here
encamped, that won me the name among the natives of
&quot;Chota Sahib,&quot; the &quot;Langur,&quot; the &quot;small sir,&quot; the &quot;monkey,&quot;
a name of which I have been proud ever since.</p>

<p>Some seventy-three miles from Pithoragarh the Shankula
River enters the Kali, the course of the Shankula being
roughly from N.N.W. to S.S.E.</p>

<p>The track once crossed, the Shankula stream tends towards
the South-East and with a gentle incline rises to 8570 feet at
Gibti, where I encamped somewhat above the Gala Daramsalla.
I had gone through forests of maple, beech, oak and
rhododendrons, with a thick undergrowth of scrub and
bamboo.</p>

<p>The Kali River, about two thousand feet down below my
camp, marks the boundary between Nepal and Kumaon.
From this high point the foaming stream can be seen for
miles, winding between thickly wooded hills and mountains
like a silver ribbon on a dark reposeful background.</p>

<p>The march from my last camp was a very short one, so I
had the greater part of the day left for work. Previously I
had usually halted in Daramsallas (stone-walled shelters),
and in default of these my men put up for me a neatly-made
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_55" id="Pg_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span>
&quot;Chahna&quot;<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> or &quot;ch&ouml;pper,&quot; a hut of mats and branches of
trees, in the construction of which the Paharis are wonderfully
dexterous. I had also my small &quot;mountain tent,&quot; a
<i>tente d'abri</i>, quite comfortable enough for ordinary requirements.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<img src="./images/55_th.jpg" alt="The Tent" title="The Tent" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">The Tent</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>It seems, however, that this style of travelling is not considered
<i>comme il faut</i> by the officials of India. It is the
number and size of one's tents, according to these authorities,
that make one a greater or a smaller gentleman! I had put
up my tent&mdash;three feet high, seven feet long, and four feet
wide&mdash;by the side of the two double-leaf eighty pound tents of
the Deputy Commissioner, but this official and his companions
were far from pleased with this act of familiarity. For a
double-tented sahib to be seen in company of another
sahib whose bijou tent rose from the ground hardly up to
one's waist, was <i>infra dig</i> and a serious threat to the prestige
of the British in India. I was therefore politely requested
to move from my cosy quarters to a more dignified abode
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_56" id="Pg_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
lent me by the one-eyed Lal Sing, a Tokudar<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> and brother
of the Patwari.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Being thus promoted in everybody's estimation except my
own, I wrote and copied out my first article for <i>The Daily
Mail</i>, and, having done this, I dined and spent a pleasant
evening with Mr. G.</p>

<p>The night was stormy; the wind shook my tent. I went
to sleep wrapped in my solitary camel-hair blanket. Some
hours later a sharp knock on my head woke me. It was the
centre pole of the tent that had moved out of its sockets and
had fallen on me. This was followed by a rushing noise of
canvas, and I found myself in a moment uncovered and
gazing at the stars.</p>

<p>There were white things flying about in the air, and, to
my horror, I discovered the leaves of my <i>Daily Mail</i> article
scattered in the wind.</p>

<p>I jumped up, but of the ten or twelve foolscap leaves on
very thin paper, I only managed to recover two or three.
The others soared gracefully to and fro in the air, and I
suppose settled eventually in the Kali. This meant recopying
the article next day, a tedious job when you are burning to
get on.</p>

<p>The sun rose. The camp began to wake up. All were
shivering with cold. I took my usual cold bath surrounded
by a half-frozen crowd of astonished onlookers, wrapped up
in their thick woollen blankets, crouching round me with
their chins on their knees.</p>

<p>The tent was recovered after a while, and soon all was
ready to start.</p>

<h5>The <i>Nerpani</i>, or &quot;waterless track&quot;&mdash;Exaggerated accounts&mdash;A
long shot&mdash;The rescue of two coolies&mdash;Picturesque Nature&mdash;An
involuntary shower-bath&mdash;The <i>Chai</i> Pass.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> renowned <i>Nerpani</i>, or <i>Nerpania</i>, &quot;waterless track,&quot;
begins at Gibti. Very few travellers have been on this road, and by the
accounts brought back many people have been prevented from imitating
their example.</p>

<p class="figcenter">The Nerpani Road</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Personally I found the track far better than I anticipated. I have been
on worse mountain roads among less precipitous cliffs. From what I had
heard it seemed as if the greater part of the road for several miles was
supported on crowbars fixed in the rock, but such is not the case. Here
and there, however, are found along the track spots overhanging
precipices; and where the perpendicular cliff did not allow of a road to
be cut except at great expense, crowbars have been more or less firmly
planted horizontally in the rock, and a narrow path made over them with
large slabs of stone. The drop from the path to the river is often from
eighteen hundred to two thousand feet, and the path is in many places no
wider than six inches. But to any surefooted traveller that would not
constitute a real danger. The road is tedious, for the Nerpania cliff along which it has been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_58" id="Pg_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
constructed is subdivided into three smaller cliffs, separated
in turn one from the other by ravines. It is thus troublesome
to climb up and down some thousands of feet, each
time along interminable and badly put together flights of
steps, only to descend again on the other side. Some of
the descents, especially the last to Gulamla, are precipitous,
but with no nails in one's shoes and no stick in one's hand,
there is really very little danger for people accustomed to
mountaineering.</p>

<p>These are the main elevations on the road: Gibti, 8650 feet,
6750 feet, 7600 feet, 6700 feet, 7100 feet, 6600 feet from Gulamla.
At bearings magnetic 350&deg;, going close to the river-bed
through a gorge, one obtains a fine view of a huge gneiss
peak towering on the left side of the <i>Neganza</i> or <i>Nejangar</i>
Mountain. This peculiar rock, shaped like a fortress, goes
by the name of the Ladjekut Peak and rises where the
Nejangar River meets the Kali. Here we pitched our tents.</p>

<p>Towards sunset there was much agitation in camp over
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_59" id="Pg_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
the appearance of wild goats on the other side of the Kali
River in Nepal.</p>

<p>&quot;Your rifle, Sahib, your rifle!&quot; shouted a chorus of
impatient natives. &quot;Quick, quick, your rifle!&quot;</p>

<p>I seized my Mannlicher and followed the excited gang to a
place some hundred yards away, where a large boisterous
crowd had collected to watch the game.</p>

<p>&quot;Where are they?&quot; said I, as I could not see anything.</p>

<p>&quot;There, there!&quot; they all screamed at the top of their
voices, pointing to the summit of the opposite cliff over four
hundred yards distant.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, that is too far.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, Sahib, please shoot,&quot; they all implored.</p>

<p>I put up the Lyman back-sight to four hundred yards, took
aim and fired. Down came rolling from rock to rock the
poor wild goat, amid the frantic excitement of the crowd
around me. It rolled down until it came to the shrub and
vegetation, where its progress became slower. It fell on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_60" id="Pg_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
the small trees and, bending them by its weight, it would
drop a few seconds later on to a lower one. The trepidation
on our side was intense. At last the graceful body stuck
across a bigger tree and swung on it for some minutes. The
oscillation slowly ceased, and tree and goat became motionless.
There our prey stuck fast.</p>

<p>Hatchets were immediately produced, and two tall trees
hurriedly cut and felled. A bridge was being spanned
to cross the dangerous cold and swift waters of the Kali.
A tree was thrown across, and its point just about reached
a high rock on the other side. Then, amidst a dead silence,
a coolie balanced himself over it. He had nearly reached
the opposite bank when there was a crash. The tree broke,
and the man was in the water, frightened and screaming
pitifully, clutching a branch with convulsive fingers.</p>

<p>Another coolie went to his rescue, but the tree being now
swung by the current, he also was pitched into the water.
It was only after a terrible moment of suspense that our men
had the common sense to draw the tree back towards the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_61" id="Pg_61"></a>[<a href="./images/61.png">61</a>]</span>
shore. One and all joined in a supreme effort, and the two
men were eventually saved.</p>

<p>Our way to the next camp was first through a high narrow gorge. A
beautiful waterfall on terraces faced us. From 6700 feet, the road
ascended to 7650 feet, then on flights of steps and in places over
crowbars the weary traveller descended to 7000 feet, where at Malpa the
road was for a space nearly level. The Malpa River, running from North to
South, was crossed. On the Nepal side across the Kali the vegetation was
luxuriant, while on the Kumaon side it was sparse and bare. Farther on
another beautiful waterfall.</p>

<p>The track now rose on a steep incline to 8120 feet
among huge rocks and boulders. What with the gigantic
snow-peaks, the pretty waterfalls, the weird character
of the country traversed, one got so interested in one's
surroundings that one forgot all about any difficulty of
climbing. From barren hills and rocks the track suddenly
became clayish and sandy, and in a series of zigzags well
shaded by <i>Tchuk, Utish</i>, and <i>Ritch</i> trees, with a thick undergrowth
of scrub wood and stunted vegetation, we found
ourselves down as low as 6750 feet, ascending immediately
after in a very short distance to 8100 feet to Camp
Lahmari.</p>

<p>In olden times the path went over the highest part of
the cliff, and it took a good walker the whole day to reach
from one spring of water to the next, hence the name of
&quot;waterless.&quot;</p>

<p>Here practically ended the <i>Nerpani</i> (waterless track),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_62" id="Pg_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
and an involuntary shower-bath soon awaited the passer-by,
drenching him to the skin, unless he was provided with
waterproof and umbrella. The spray descended from a
great height for a length of some thirty or forty yards, the
road being very narrow and very slippery, so that progress
was particularly slow. The name of the waterfall was <i>Takti</i>.</p>

<p>The track, if not more level, was nevertheless better after
this to the sore-footed walker. It was less rocky and devoid
of the tiresome flights of steps.</p>

<p>On leaving Lahmari we immediately had a steep rise to
9600 feet. Then a drop of 400 feet, and we found ourselves
on the Buddi River, a tributary of the Kali. Just above the
bridge was a magnificent waterfall, by the left side of which
we found a kind of grotto hollowed out under a rock. The
Shokas and Tibetans used it as a camping ground.</p>

<p>To our right, high up on the cliffside, was the picturesque
village of Buddi (9300 feet), with its two- and three-storeyed
houses. Below and over it in long zigzags could be seen
the track ascending to the top of <i>Chai-Lek</i>, or <i>Tcheto</i> Pass as
the Shokas call it. At bearings magnetic 170&deg; we had the
towering Namjun peak, so high that I was told it could be
seen even from Almora and Ranikhet.</p>

<p>Then as we proceeded up the steep clayish track, I could
not, on looking back, help admiring the magnificent Kali
valley with its gigantic cliffs and gorges surmounted by lofty
snow peaks. On the <i>Chai</i> Pass the two aneroids I had on
me registered an altitude of 11,190 feet. I was now on a
small flat tableland. Darcy Bura, the richest Shoka trader
from Buddi, had erected here a bargain-house for the purchase
and exchange of borax, salt, wool, and other articles from
Tibet. On the left side of the road a large cave in the rock had
been walled and partly roofed over for the use of wife-seekers
from the villages of Buddi and Garbyang. These houses
were called <i>Rambangs</i>, and were an old institution among
the Shokas, of which I shall have occasion to speak at
length later on. As everywhere else, a few high poles with
flying prayers and a bell had been placed near the pass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> arrival at Garbyang was watched by hundreds of men,
women, and children, all squatting on the edge of the flat
mud roofs of their habitations, while a few dozen people
followed me respectfully to my camping ground beyond the
village. A large tent had been put up for me by Pundit
Gobaria's brother, who had been informed of my coming
by Anti Ram Sah, my banker at Almora. Mr. G., Deputy
Commissioner, arrived later.</p>

<p>I was very anxious to make immediate arrangements to
enter Tibet, but all my efforts to obtain reliable followers
were of little avail.</p>

<p>I heard to my regret, a day or two later, that the plan of
my journey, which with so much trouble and care I had
kept secret, had been divulged to the Tibetan authorities.
Misfortunes never come singly! Against my will I had been
advised to pay a certain sum at Almora, in exchange for
which I received a letter of credit on Pundit Gobaria, a rich
trader of Garbyang, who was to pay me the amount in
silver. Unluckily, Gobaria was still absent in Nepal, and no
one else could cash a cheque for the amount I wanted.
This was tiresome&mdash;all the more so as I had counted on
the money. I immediately sent a runner to Almora to have
the sum in silver sent at once. This involved much publicity
and considerable risk.</p>

<p>Also delay was inevitable. All the passes were closed
and fresh snow was falling daily. It was just possible with
much difficulty for a man to cross the Lippu Pass, but no
baggage could be taken through. I made up my mind to
remain a few days in Garbyang, and took this opportunity
to have a large Tibetan tent manufactured to shelter my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_64" id="Pg_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
future followers&mdash;if ever I could find any&mdash;and it might help
me, I calculated, to become friendly with the natives, among
whom I hoped to find some willing followers.</p>

<p>Doctor H. Wilson, of the Methodist Evangelical Mission,
went to much trouble in trying to get together men for me,
but though his influence was and is considerable in Bias
and Chaudas, his efforts were not crowned with success.
The Shokas know well how terribly cruel the Tibetans are.
They have suffered at their hands more than once, and even
of recent years the Government of India has had reported
by its own officers cases of horrible tortures inflicted by
the Tibetan authorities on British subjects captured by
them on our side of the frontier. Some of the atrocities
committed by the Lamas on British subjects are revolting,
and it is a matter of great regret and indignation to the
Englishmen who visit these regions to think that the weakness
of our officials in Kumaon has allowed and is allowing
such proceedings still to go on. So incapable are they, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_65" id="Pg_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
fact, that the Jong Pen of Taklakot in Tibet sends over,
&quot;with the sanction of the Government of India,&quot; his yearly
emissaries to collect Land Revenue<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> from British subjects
living on British soil. The Shokas have to pay this tribute,
and do so out of fear&mdash;in addition to other taxes and trade
dues iniquitously exacted by the Tibetans.</p>

<p>On the slightest pretext the Tibetans arrest, torture mercilessly,
fine, and confiscate property of, British subjects on
British territory.</p>

<p>At the time of my visit there could be seen, in Garbyang
and other villages, British subjects (Shokas) who had been
mutilated by the Tibetan authorities.</p>

<p>Even Dr. H. Wilson, who had erected a dispensary at
Gungi (one march beyond Garbyang), was lately threatened
with confiscation&mdash;and worse perhaps&mdash;if he did not
immediately comply with the exactions of the Tibetans.
He declined to do so and reported the matter to the Government,
relying on a good rifle in the house and his many
servants. His determination not to be intimidated seems to
have given him temporary security, for the Tibetans are
as cowardly, when they think themselves matched, as they
are cruel.</p>

<p>Let me quote one example of cruelty which occurred
as late as 1896. A Shoka trader, undeniably a British
subject, had gone over the border, as is customary with
them during the summer, to dispose of his merchandise
on the Tibetan market. He and another Shoka, also a
British subject, had a quarrel. Aware that the first Shoka
was wealthy, the Tibetan authorities took this pretext to
arrest him and impose upon him an exorbitant fine, besides
the additional punishment of two hundred lashes to be
administered to him by order of the Jong Pen. The Shoka
remonstrated on the plea that he had done no harm, and
that being a British subject they had no right to so
punish him. The Jong Pen saw his orders executed, and
further commanded his men to cut off the wretched
prisoner's hands. He was made over to two soldiers
entrusted with the carrying out of the sentence. They
led him away to the place of punishment. The Shoka
was of a powerful build and possessed courage. Though
half dead and covered with wounds, he overcame his
guardians and escaped. The alarm was instantly given
and a large party of horsemen sent to capture him.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_66" id="Pg_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span></p>

<p>They caught him up, and when at close range fired on him and wounded him
in the knee, smashing the kneecap. He was surrounded, pounced upon,
beaten mercilessly, and last but not least, all his fingers were one by
one crushed into pulp between two heavy stones. In this condition he was
dragged before the Lamas, only to be decapitated! Mr. Sturt, an able and
just officer, who was then Deputy Commissioner at Almora, became
acquainted with these facts, and, having fully ascertained their
accuracy, reported them to the Government, strongly advising immediate
action against the Tibetans for this and other cruelties that were
constantly taking place on our frontier. Though it was undeniably proved
that the victim was a British subject, the Government of India took no
steps in the matter.</p>

<p>The same year, 1896, Lieutenant Gaussen, who on a shooting trip tried to
enter Tibet by the Lippu Pass, was surrounded by Tibetan soldiers, and he
and his servants were seriously ill-treated. The British officer received
a nasty wound on his forehead, and one of his servants, who behaved
heroically, was so cruelly handled that to-day, two years later, I hear
he is still an invalid.</p>

<p>Mr. J. Larkin, Deputy Collector at Almora, was then despatched to the
frontier. No better man could have been sent. Firm, just, and
painstaking, he became popular and much respected among the Shokas. He
listened to their troubles and sufferings; he administered justice
wherever possible. He refused audience to no one, and during his flying
visit became well acquainted with the country, the people, and all that
went on. The poor Shokas felt much relieved, thinking that at last the
Tibetan abuses would be put an end to. They were not mistaken, at least for a</p>

time. The Jong Pen of Taklakot was called upon to answer
for his many misdeeds. He refused an interview. Mr.
Larkin sent word across the border that he would have no
trifling and that he must come, upon which the Jong
Pen, with his officers and Lamas, crossed the snowy
Lippu Pass. Trembling with fear and bending low to
the ground, the Tibetans, with abject servility, entered
the tent of our British envoy. The account of the interview,
which I received in full from a Shoka gentleman who
was present as interpreter, is amusing and curious, showing
the mutability and hypocrisy of the Tibetans. In the long
run, and being well acquainted with the cowardice of his
visitors, Mr. Larkin not only obtained redress on every point
but gave the Jong Pen and his officers a severe harangue.
The result of the interview was that the collection of the
Land Revenue should be put a stop to, and that Tibetan law
should no more be administered on our side of the frontier.</p>

<p>Mr. Larkin's visit to Bhot was cut short by urgent orders
to return immediately to Almora.</p>

<p>The following year (the year of my visit, 1897), Mr. G.,
Deputy Commissioner, undid much that the previous officer
had accomplished. The Jong Pen, when summoned,
declined to come, and sent over deputies in his place. The
upshot of it is, that Land Revenue is again paid by the
Shokas to the Tibetan tax-collectors through the Peshkar.</p>

<p>I have mentioned these facts as representative of many,
and to show how it came that the natives, who had never
had any protection from our Government, were disinclined,
notwithstanding the temptations I offered them, to brave
the dangers of Tibet. I, who later on suffered so much
through being betrayed by Shokas, am the first to forgive
and not to blame them. Though nominally our subjects,
their actual rulers are the Tibetans, and we do nothing to
protect them against the exactions and tortures of the
intruders. Why then should we expect them to be faithful
to us? The Shokas are not treacherous by nature, but
they are compelled to be deceitful to protect their lives
and their homes. Properly treated, these honest, gentle,
good-natured mountaineers would assuredly become loyal
and trustworthy subjects of her Majesty.</p>

<h5>Tibetan threats&mdash;My birthday&mdash;Ravenous dogs&mdash;A big dinner&mdash;Shoka
hospitality.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Jong Pen of Taklakot, on hearing of my proposed visit, sent threats
that he would confiscate the land of any man who came in my employ,
besides menaces of &quot;flogging&quot; and subsequent
&quot;beheading&quot; of myself and any one caught with me. Personally I
paid little attention to these intimidations.</p>

<p>Consulting the
calendar one day&mdash;a thing I did with great regularity in these
regions&mdash;I made out that it was the first of June, and I then
remembered that the following day would be my birthday.
Feasts were scarce in these high altitudes, and the prospect
before me was that they would in the near future be even
scarcer. It therefore occurred to me that I could not better
while away a day at least of this weary waiting than by treating
myself to a real big feast.</p>

<p>Chanden Sing was despatched round the village to
summon up to my tent all the local Bunyas (tradespeople).
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_70" id="Pg_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>
Rice, flour, eight pounds of butter (<i>ghi</i>), a large quantity of
lump sugar, pepper, salt, and a fat sheep were purchased.
The latter was forthwith beheaded, skinned, and dressed in
the approved fashion by the faithful Chanden Sing, who
was indeed a jack of all trades.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I am a careless house or rather tent
keeper, and I entrusted my chaprassis with the job of
stowing away the provisions, for which purpose a recess
under the native low bedstead served to perfection, holding
as it did the different-sized vessels, with the <i>bachri</i> (sheep)
in pieces, and the rice, flour, butter, etc.</p>

<p>While this was being done, I worked away hard at
writing, and getting interested, continued at it till an early
hour of the morning; I got tired at last, and, wrapping
myself up in my blanket, I soon went to sleep next to a
heap of stones piled up by the cautious Chanden Sing.</p>

<p>&quot;Sahib,&quot; had been his warning, &quot;there are many hungry
dogs about. If they come, here are a few missiles ready
for them!&quot; and he pointed at the ammunition.</p>

<p>&quot;All right; good-night.&quot;</p>

<p>The wisdom of this was soon apparent, for I had not
slept long when I was aroused by the hollow sound of lip-smacking,
apparently arising from more than one mouth,
accompanied by the movement of the stretched canvas bed
on which I was lying. Jumping to my feet, I alighted upon
a living mass of unwelcome guests; but before I even
realised what had been going on, they had scampered away,
the brutes! carrying between their tightly-closed jaws a last
mouthful of my dainties.</p>

<p>The ammunition at my disposal was quickly used up&mdash;a
poor revenge, even when I heard the yell of a dog I happened
to hit in the dark. On striking a match, I found the
large brass bowls emptied, the rice and flour scattered all
over the tent, and the sheep practically vanished.</p>

<p>I determined not to be done out of this piece of indulgence,
which now seemed desirable beyond words,
although I crawled back into my blanket, and found for
a while oblivion in sleep. I was no sooner up in the
morning than I planned a new banquet. But in the
nick of time, Mr. G., who had gone a march farther,
returned with his escort of policemen, <i>moonshees</i>, pundits,
and chaprassis.</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind, Landor,&quot; said he kindly, when I had told
him of my trouble, &quot;you come and dine with me. These
chaps shall get you up a special dinner in their own
way.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_71" id="Pg_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>
My stores were put under tribute, instead of the native
Bunyas, and we had a very excellent meal indeed. We
had Bovril soup and Irish stew, roast mutton, potted
tongue, roast chicken, gigantic swan eggs poached on
anchovy toast, jam omelette, chow-chow preserves, ginger
biscuits, boiled rhubarb, and I must not forget, by the way,
an excellent plum cake of no small dimensions, crammed
full of raisins and candy, which I had brought from Mrs. G.
at Almora to her husband, and to which we did, with blessings
for her, the fullest justice.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Thanks to Mr. G. and also to the fortunate coincidence of
receiving a batch of letters from parents and friends, which
reached me on that day by runner from Khela, I do not
think that I could have spent a happier birthday anywhere,
and I knew well enough that these were to be the last
moments of contentment&mdash;an end to the fleshpots of
Egypt. After this I should be cut off from civilisation,
from comfort even in its primitive form; and to emphasise
this fact, it happened that on the very morning follow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_72" id="Pg_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>ing
my birthday, Mr. G. left and continued his journey to
Almora.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The weather was cold and rain fell in torrents, the
thermometer being never above 52&deg; during the warmest
hours of the day. My soaked tent stood in a regular pool
of water, notwithstanding the double trenches round it, and
several Shoka gentlemen had before asked me to abandon
it and live in a house. They were all most anxious to
extend to me hospitality, which I, not wishing to trouble
them, and in order at all hazards to be entirely free and
unhampered in my actions, courteously but firmly declined.
Nevertheless, quite a deputation arrived on June 4, renewing
their request; but I was determined to have my way. In
vain! They would not see a Sahib under cold canvas
while they themselves had comfortable homes. They held
a consultation. Unexpectedly, and notwithstanding my
remonstrances, my loads were suddenly seized and carried
triumphantly on the backs of a long row of powerful Shokas
towards the village. I had to follow <i>nolens volens</i>, and from
that day on I grew through constant contact daily more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_73" id="Pg_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
convinced of the genuine friendliness and kindheartedness
of these people.</p>

<p>To prevent my coming back, they even pulled down the
tent, and, wet as it was, carried it away. Zeheram and
Jaimal, two leading Shokas, held my hands and patted me
on the back as they led me with every sign of courtesy to
my new dwelling.</p>

<p>This turned out to be a fine two-storeyed building with
nicely carved wooden door and windows coloured red and
green. So great was the anxiety and fear of these good
people that I should turn back at this juncture, that some
twenty outstretched hands seized me by the arms, while
others pushed me from behind up a flight of ten or twelve
steps into the house, where I found myself the guest of my
good friend Zeheram. I was given the front of the first
floor, consisting of two large clean rooms, with a very fair
native bedstead, a table and two or more <i>moras</i> (round
cane stools covered with skin); and I had no sooner
realised that I must stay than presents of sweets, preserved
fruit, dried dates, and tea were brought for my
acceptance&mdash;tea made in the Tibetan fashion with butter
and salt in it.</p>

<p>Even if at first I had had slight apprehensions at the
expression of such very unusual hospitality, these were soon
dispelled, and I was proud to be assured by my host that I
was the first Englishman (or for that, European or American)
who had been allowed to enter the living part of a
Shoka house and partake of food in a Shoka dwelling. The
opportunity was too good to be lost, and I was sorely
tempted to tarry among them, so as really to get an insight
into their mode of living, their customs and manners.</p>

<h5>Shoka hospitality&mdash;How I obtained much information&mdash;On a
reconnoitring trip&mdash;A terrible slide.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> are indeed Nature's gentlemen, these worthy Shokas,
and as such they did all in their power to make my stay
among them pleasant. It was a contest between them as to
who should entertain me first, and who should be the next.
Invitations to breakfast and dinner literally poured in; and
those convenient &quot;sick headaches,&quot; &quot;colds,&quot; and &quot;previous
engagements,&quot; so opportune in more conventional parts,
were of no avail here. No card&mdash;no friendly note bade one
to come and be merry. They generally arrived <i>en masse</i> to
fetch me. Pulling and pushing played a not unimportant
part in their urging, and to decline was thus out of the
question. Indeed I must confess there was but little inclination
to decline on my part. When you arrived, your host
spread out fine mats and rugs, of Tibetan and ancient Chinese
manufacture, and often of great value. In front of a raised
seat were displayed in shiny brass bowls the various viands
and delicacies which constituted the meal. There was rice
always; there was curried mutton, milk and curd with
sugar; then <i>chapatis</i> made in Hindustani fashion and <i>Shale</i>,
a kind of sweet pancake made of flour, <i>ghi</i> (butter), sugar or
honey, also <i>Parsad</i>, a thick paste of honey, burnt sugar,
butter and flour, all well cooked together&mdash;a dainty morsel
even for a jaded palate.</p>

<p>I was invariably made to sit on the raised seat, which I
did cross-legged, while the crowd squatted respectfully on
the floor round the room, forming a semicircle with me in
the center. I generally ate with my fingers in their own
manner, a courtesy they particularly appreciated, and
although I must have seemed awkward to them at first, I
soon acquired a sort of dexterity in manipulating hot food&mdash;meat
and vegetables, for instance&mdash;with my hand. The trick
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_75" id="Pg_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
is not very difficult, but it requires practice. You gather up
your five fingers downwards in the dish, seizing a mouthful,
and with a rapid circular twist of the hand you collect as
much sauce as you can round the morsel you have caught.
With a still more rapid movement, and before anything has
time to drip between your fingers, you half drop and half
throw it into your mouth.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I soon found that I could, during these cordial repasts,
enlivened as they were by moderate libations of <i>ch&ouml;kti</i> and
<i>syrap</i> (wine and spirit distilled from wheat), acquire considerable
knowledge of anthropological and ethnological
interest, and gather also much valuable information about
Tibet and its people. They became, in fact, in the few days
I spent among them, confiding to such a degree, and looked
upon me so much as one of themselves, that I soon obtained
the run of the whole place. They came to confide their
grievances and troubles; they related to me their legends
and folk-lore. They sang to me their weird songs and
taught me their dances. They brought me to their marriages
and strange funerals; they took me to their sick men,
women, and children, or conveyed them to me for cure.
Thus, to my delight, and with such unique chances, my
observations of a pathological, physiological, and anatomical
character became more interesting to me day by day, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_76" id="Pg_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
I have attempted to describe in a later chapter some of
the things I was able to note.</p>

<p>After lingering in Garbyang for several days, I paid off my two
chaprassis, Matan Sing and Narenghiri, and they returned to Almora.</p>

<p>On June 6 I started on a journey towards the frontier, with a view to
reconnoitre.</p>

<p>Crossing into Nepal territory below Chongur village, and following
upwards the right bank of the Kali River in a direction of 320&deg;
(bearings magnetic) I reached Kanwa, a Shoka village on a high cliff-like
plateau under which meet the three rivers Kali, Taki, and Kuti. The Kali
turns suddenly to 37&deg; (bearings magnetic), while the Kuti River keeps
a general direction of 325&deg; (bearings magnetic).</p>

<p>Having crossed again
into Kumaon, I struck camp at Gungi. Before entering the
village, I passed Dr. Wilson's dispensary, not then completed.
In the village the houses were decorated with long poles
joined by strings, from which hung and flew gaily in the
breeze hundreds of wind prayers. The dwellings were
mostly of the ancient, pure Shoka architecture, and not so
fine or so clean as those in Garbyang. The place was
picturesque, clear-cut against the curious background of the
dome-like mountain, the Nabi Shankom, a peak of uncommon
beauty with its grey and reddish striped strata.
Near it on another mountain is the Gungi Shankom, a
gigantic quadrangular rock of a warm yellow and reddish
colour, not unlike a huge tower. When I reached its foot,
the sun was casting his last dying rays on it, and the picture
was so magical that I was tempted to sketch it. As I sat
there, the shadow of the coming night rose higher and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_77" id="Pg_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>higher on the mountain-side, tinting it violet blue, and above
it the Gungi Shankom stood resplendent in all its glory like
a tower of fire&mdash;till night descended covering the mountain
first, and little by little the Gungi Shankom itself. I shall
not easily forget this
sight.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Gungi Shankom</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>I slept under my little <i>tente d'abri</i> and found it delightfully cosy and
warm.</p>

<p>At 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the next day I raised camp. The elevation here was 10,940
feet. Interesting was the <i>Chiram</i>, a collection of tombs, five in
number, made of slabs of white stone with poles placed vertically upon
them, and from the summit of which hung flying prayers. The Kuti River to
my left was wide and rapid. On the opposite bank the village of Ronkan
(11,100 feet) made a pretty <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> to the Nabi village on our
side of the stream, at the same elevation, and directly under the lee of
the Nabi Shankom.</p>

<p>As I rose gradually along the river course the vegetation
grew sparse, and in front of me there remained nothing but
barren rocks and high snowy peaks. The spot where, from
opposite sides, the Gunkan River and the Nail River throw
themselves into the Kuti River is most picturesque. There
are on the water's edge a few pine-trees, but above there
is nothing but wilderness&mdash;rock and ice and snow.</p>

<p>I soon came upon much snow, and places where the track
along the mountain-side was undiscoverable. Walking was
tiresome enough on the loose shingle and shale, but it
became worse when I actually had to cut each step into the
frozen snow. The work was tedious to a degree, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_78" id="Pg_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
progress slow. After a while I noticed a series of lofty snow
tunnels over the raging stream, which is earlier in the season
covered entirely by a vault of ice and snow. The higher
I got the harder and more slippery grew the snow. The
soles of my shoes having become soaked and frozen
made walking very difficult. At 12,000 feet, being about
three hundred feet above the stream, I had to cross a particularly
extensive snow-field, hard frozen and rising at a
very steep angle. Some of my coolies had gone ahead, the
others were behind. Notwithstanding the track cut by those
ahead, it was necessary to re-cut each step with one's own
feet, so as to prevent slipping. This was best done by
hammering several times into the white sheet with the point
of one's shoe until a cavity was made deep enough to contain
the foot and to support one upright. It ought to be
done carefully each time, but I fear I had not the patience
for that. I thought I had found a quicker method, and by
raising my knee high, I struck the snow with my heel, leaving
my foot planted until the other one had by the same process
cut the next step.</p>

<p>It was in giving one of these vigorous thumps that I hit a
spot where, under a thin coating of snow, was hard ice.</p>

<p>My foot, failing in its grip, slipped, and the impulse caused me to lose
my balance. I slid down the steep incline at a terrific pace, accompanied
in my involuntary tobogganing over ice and snow by the screams of my
horror-stricken coolies. I realised that in another moment I should be
pitched into the stream, which would have meant being carried under the
long tunnel of ice to meet certain death beneath it. In those few seconds
I found time to speculate even as to whether those stones by the water's
edge would stop me, or whether the impetus must fling me past them into
the river. I attempted to get a grip in the snow with my frozen fingers,
to stem myself with my heels, but with no success, when I saw ahead of me
a large stone rising above the snow. With desperate tension of every
nerve and muscle, I knew as I approached it, with the foaming water
yonder, that it was my only hope. I consciously straightened my legs for
the contact. The bump was tremendous, and seemed to shatter every bone in
my body. But it stopped me, and I was saved only a few feet from the
water's edge&mdash;miraculously, although fearfully bruised, with no
bones broken.</p>

<p>My fingers were cut by the ice and bleeding. When I
was able to stand, I signalled to the frightened and wailing
coolies above to go on, and I myself proceeded along the
watercourse until I found a spot from which I could regain
the upper track.</p>

<h5>A palaver&mdash;To see is to believe&mdash;Dangers and perils on the
snow and ice&mdash;<i>Thar</i> and <i>Ghural</i>&mdash;Stalking&mdash;A tiring climb to
16,000 feet&mdash;The collapse of a snow bridge.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Kuti I halted and summoned the leading natives to my
tent.</p>

<p>Would it be possible, I asked them, to get over the
Lumpiya Pass or the still higher Mangshan? The first is a
rarely frequented pass on the way to Gyanema, the other
a high and most difficult pass by which it is possible, though
not easy, to reach the Rakstal Lake by the jungle without
going near a Tibetan settlement or encampment.</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; was the decided answer from all the Shokas. &quot;The
snow is now too deep. Fresh snow falls daily. For another
fortnight at least no human being can get across. To
attempt it will mean losing one's life. At their best during
one month in summer, those two passes are arduous and
dangerous. Now it would be mere folly to attempt their
ascent.&quot;</p>

<p>With my distressingly sceptical nature I believe little that
I do not see. I started next morning to observe for myself.
My bearings were roughly North-West. Seeing me determined,
several of the Kutial Shokas changed their mind and
volunteered to follow me. They were of considerable help
in many dangerous places. Here and there a few paces of
narrow track were uncovered, otherwise we went long distances
on frozen snow, over precipices down which it was
almost fatal to look.</p>

<p>The lucky hairbreadth escape of the previous day contributed
to make me lose confidence, not in myself, but in
that white emblem of purity and innocence, in reality the
most treacherous substance in creation. I soon found that
wherever there was snow there was trouble. In spots where
the snow was particularly hard frozen we dared not attempt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_82" id="Pg_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
to walk on the steep slippery surface, and we had to descend
to the river, which was here bridged over completely with
ice and snow. Crossing, we would attempt progress on
the other side, and having proceeded with difficulty for a few
hundred yards, had to retrace our steps and try the first
bank again. We thus crossed and recrossed the Kuti River
more than half-a-dozen times, each crossing being preceded
by a precipitous descent and immediately followed by a steep
ascent. The cracks in the ice by the water-side were constant
and perilous, and we did not risk remaining near
them longer than was necessary. In six or seven hours we
had walked a distance of less than four miles. Leaving the
Kuti River and following due North the course of a tributary,
the Kambelshio, we crossed over to its farther bank
and pitched our tents at an altitude of 13,420 feet.</p>

<p>There remained a few hours of daylight when we arrived,
and I employed them by going after <i>Thar</i> or <i>Tehr</i> and
<i>Ghural</i> (Himahlyan chamois) a couple of miles farther.
I rose to 15,000 feet on a needle-like peak towering over the
spot where, in a narrow picturesque gorge, the Tongzu</p>

pangti enters the Kuti River. The sources of the Tongzu
pangti are about a thousand feet higher than the spot where
it meets the Kuti River, and the stream has its birth from the
melting snows, descending precipitously and in a very short
distance into the larger river.</p>

<p>The rocks are here furred with saltpetre, and it is said to
be a favourite spot for Thar.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>I enjoyed my trip so much that, rising with the sun,
I started on the following morning to repeat my experience.
Moreover, I wanted to climb to some high point wherefrom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_85" id="Pg_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
I could make certain whether it was possible to proceed
immediately across the Himahlyan range, or whether it was
advisable to wait patiently until the snow had to some
extent disappeared. I walked four miles from camp,
reaching an altitude of 16,000 feet. The ascent was
rather tiring. Having wounded a Thar, I went after it up
a fatiguing snow-field at a speed too great to be comfortable
at such a very high elevation. When I reached
the top, I was out of breath and the Thar too far off for a
second shot.</p>

<p>The view this high point commanded was stupendous.
For miles and miles&mdash;and it seemed hundreds of miles&mdash;snow,
snow, nothing but snow! There stood Jolinkan
Mount rising above 19,000 feet. On either side of the
Kuti River were peaks as high as 20,000 feet and
more. Here and there the white sheet that covered the
surrounding country seemed almost greenish. Those
spots were glaciers, and I saw many of them, feeding as
they do the numerous streams flowing into the Kuti
River. I returned to camp for lunch. It was useless to
proceed and even more useless remaining still. I gave
orders to raise the camp, and at 2 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> we were under
way back to Kuti.</p>

<p>The day had been an unusually warm one, and the surface
of the snow, so hard the previous day, was now soft and
watery. Several of the snow bridges had already disappeared.</p>

<p>I had descended to the river preceded by some of my
coolies. Two of them just in front of me were crossing
over the stream on a thick and broad archway of ice. I
was waiting for them to be safely across. When the men
had nearly reached the other side they noticed a peculiar
vibration underfoot. Scrambling away as best they could,
they gave the alarm.</p>

<p>I drew back hastily. In the nick of time! for with a
deafening roar like magnified thunder echoed from cliff to
cliff, down went the bridge. The huge pieces of ice, only a
moment before forming part of the vault, were now swept
away by the furious stream and thrown with tremendous
force against the next bridge, which quivered under the
terrible clash.</p>

<p>Three days' marching over the same route brought me
back to Garbyang.</p>

<h5>An earthquake&mdash;Curious notions of the natives&mdash;A Shoka
tailor and his ways&mdash;The arrival of silver cash&mdash;Two rocks
in the Kali&mdash;Arrogance of a Tibetan spy.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> hearing that Dr. Wilson was now in Garbyang I went
to call upon him. Squatted on soft Chinese and Tibetan
mats and rugs, we were enjoying cup after cup of tea and
devouring <i>chapatis</i>, when suddenly the whole building
began to shake and rumble in the queerest manner, upsetting
teapot and milk and sending the <i>chapatis</i> roaming
to and fro all over the room.</p>

<p>Leaving Dr. Wilson to save our precious beverage, I
pulled out watch and compass to notice duration and
direction of the shock. It was undulatory, very violent,
and oscillating from S.S.W. to N.N.E. The duration was
exactly four minutes two seconds. The earthquake began
at 5.20 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> and ended at 5h. 24m. 2s.</p>

<p>&quot;It strikes me that it would have been wise to have gone
out of the house,&quot; said I. &quot;It is a wonder the building did
not collapse. My cup is full of mud and d&eacute;bris from the
ceiling.&quot;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>&quot;I have saved the tea for you!&quot; said the Doctor, triumphantly
lifting in his muscular hands the teapot, which he
had carefully nursed. He had soon discovered my devotion
to the yellow liquid.</p>

<p>We were quietly going on with our refreshment when a
band of excited Shokas broke into the room.</p>

<p>&quot;Sahib! Sahib! where has it gone?&quot; cried they in a
chorus, stretching their hands towards me and then folding
them in sign of prayer. &quot;Sahib! tell us where it has gone!&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_87" id="Pg_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
&quot;What?&quot; rejoined I, amused at their suspense.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you not feel the earth shake and quiver?&quot; exclaimed
the astounded visitors.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh yes, but that is nothing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no, Sahib! That is the precursory notice of some
great calamity. The 'spirit' under the earth is waking up
and is shaking its back.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would rather it shook its back than mine,&quot; said I
jokingly.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/87.jpg">
<img src="./images/87_th.jpg" alt="A Well-attended School" title="A Well-attended School" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">A Well-attended School</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>&quot;Or mine,&quot; added the Doctor lightly, much to the astonishment
of our awestricken callers.</p>

<p>&quot;Which way did it go?&quot; repeated the impatient Shokas.</p>

<p>I pointed towards the N.N.E. and they gave a sigh of
satisfaction. It must have proceeded to the other side of the
Himahlyas.</p>

<p>It appears, according to the primitive notions of the
Shokas, that inside the earth lives in a torpid condition an
evil spirit in the shape of a gigantic reptile. The rumbling
preceding an earthquake is, to the Shoka mind, nothing else
than the heavy breathing of the monster previous to waking,
whereas the actual shock is caused by the brute stretching
its limbs. When fully awake the serpent-like demon darts
and forces its way in one direction, compelling the earth to
quake all along its subterranean passage, often causing by so
violent a procedure great damage to property and loss of
life, not to speak of the fear and terror which it strikes in
man and beast, should the capricious spirit by chance make
a return journey to the spot below the earth's crust directly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_88" id="Pg_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
underfoot. It is curious and interesting, in analysing these
crude notions, to find that, independently of the cause attributed to its
origin, the Shokas are aware of the fact that an earthquake
&quot;travels&quot; in a certain direction. Moreover, common symptoms of
the approach of a violent earthquake, such as depression and heaviness in
the atmosphere, which they attribute to a feverish state of the giant
reptile, are readily recognised by them.</p>

My Banker and Agent</div>
<p>On my return to civilisation some months later I discovered that on the
same day a violent shock was felt all over India, causing considerable
damage, especially in Calcutta.</p>

<p>I had on first arriving in Garbyang ordered a tent, and the tailor who
was entrusted with its manufacture had, after several days' intoxication,
completed it. It was on the Tibetan pattern, with picturesque ornaments
in blue. He had also been making me some Nepalese clothes, and these
really turned out quite a success, no small wonder considering the way he
went to work. I had given him cloth and lining, which he took away with
him, but he never troubled to take my measure! He simply assured me that
the suit would be ready on the following day. This was of
course not the case, and on the next afternoon and for
six consecutive days he placed himself in a state of hopeless
intoxication under my window, singing, and making comical
salaams each time I, after the custom of the country, threw
something at him to induce him to go away. On the seventh
day I caught him and shook him by the ears, explaining
that if the clothes were not ready before nightfall, I would,
in default of other tailors, sew them myself.</p></div>

<p>&quot;I have a drop too much in me,&quot; confessed the amusing
rascal. &quot;I will go to sleep now. When I wake in the
afternoon I shall be sober and will finish my work. Do not
be angry, Sahib. If only you drank yourself, Sahib, you
would know how lovely it is to be drunk.&quot; His philosophy
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_89" id="Pg_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
did not agree with mine. But I felt sure that I had so
far impressed him, that he knew he must risk some personal
violence if he delayed much longer. Sure enough, late in
the evening he came with his work.</p>

<p>&quot;How they will fit I do not dare to guess,&quot; I remarked to
Dr. Wilson, &quot;considering the condition the man has been
in while making them, and taking into account that he never
measured me nor tried them on. After all, Nepalese clothes
should be tight-fitting all over.&quot;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Wonderful as it may seem, the clothes fitted like a glove.
Clearly, that man was a genius. Anyhow he was intemperate
enough to have been one.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>One day I had gone for a walk along the deserted road
from the village. I was about a mile and a half from the
inhabited part, when three men, who had been fast approaching,
stood with blunt swords in front of me. They
waved their blades clumsily and shouted at the top of their
voices in an excited manner: &quot;<i>Rupiya! Rupiya!</i>&quot; (&quot;Rupees!
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_90" id="Pg_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
Rupees!&quot;) Without thinking of the money that I had sent
for and expected to receive, I took their attitude as a threatening
demand for the cash I might have on me. They were
really grotesque in their gesticulations, and I brusquely
pushed by them and continued my constitutional. When
they saw me depart, they scurried away hastily towards
Garbyang, and I gave the occurrence no further thought.
On my return to the village, however, some hours later, a
crowd of Shokas came up to me announcing that my money
had arrived, and that the scared messengers, not daring to
come near me a second time, had gone to Dr. Wilson's
house. There I found a <i>peon</i> and two <i>chaprassis</i>, the three
men I had met on the road. They had brought a sum of
eighteen hundred rupees in silver, nearly all in two-anna
and four-anna pieces (sixteen annas to a rupee), which I had
sent for from my banker, Anti Ram Sah, at Almora, and
which it had taken three men to carry, owing to its weight.</p>

<p>After an easy explanation with these three very peaceful
highwaymen, the silver was conveyed to my room, and the
greater part of the night had to be spent in counting the
diminutive coins and packing them up in rolls of ten rupees
each.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Just below Garbyang in the Kali River were, among a
mass of others, two large rocks in the centre of the stream.
These two rocks were constantly watched by the Shokas.
The Kali, though named after a small spring below its real
source, is, like most of its tributaries, mainly fed by melting
snows. The greater quantity of water descends from the
Jolinkan, the Lumpiya, the Mangshan, the Lippu, and the
Tinker passes. The first four are in Kumaon, the last in
Nepal. It stands to reason that the warmer the weather the
greater is the quantity of snow melting on the passes, and
therefore the higher the level of the river. When the two
rocks are altogether under water all the passes are known to
be open.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>During the time I was in Garbyang I never had the luck
to see this, but the level of the river was daily rising, and
the time of tiresome expectation was certainly relieved by
many amusing, and a few awkward incidents.</p>

<p>Having once been informed of my plans, the Jong Pen of
Taklakot in Tibet was kept fully acquainted with my movements.
His spies went daily backwards and forwards with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_91" id="Pg_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
details about me. This my friends confided to me regularly.
One of these emissaries, a stalwart Tibetan, more daring than
the rest, actually had the impudence to enter my room, and
to address me in a boisterous tone of voice. At first I treated
him kindly, but he became more and more arrogant, and
informed me, before several frightened Shokas to whom he
was showing off, that the British soil I was standing on was
Tibetan property. The British, he said, were usurpers and
only there on sufferance. He declared that the English were
cowards and afraid of the Tibetans, even if they oppressed
the Shokas.</p>

<p>This remark was too much for me, and it might anyhow
have been unwise to allow it to pass unchallenged. Throwing
myself on him, I grabbed him by his pigtail and landed
in his face a number of blows straight from the shoulder.
When I let him go, he threw himself down crying, and
implored my pardon. Once and for all to disillusion the
Tibetan on one or two points, I made him lick my shoes
clean with his tongue, in the presence of the assembled
Shokas. This done, he tried to scamper away, but I caught
him once more by his pigtail, and kicked him down the front
steps which he had dared to come up unasked.</p>

<p>Chanden Sing happened to be basking in the sun at the
foot, and seeing the hated foreigner make so contemptible
an exit, leapt on him like a cat. He had heard me say,
&quot;Ye admi bura crab!&quot; (&quot;That man is very bad.&quot;) That was
enough for him, and before the Tibetan had regained his
feet, my bearer covered his angular features with a perfect
shower of blows. In the excitement of the moment, Chanden
Sing, thinking himself quite the hero, began even to shy
huge stones at his terror-stricken victim, and at last, getting
hold of his pigtail, to drag him round the yard&mdash;until I
interfered and stopped the sport.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Shoka institution, surprising in a primitive people, but
nevertheless, to my way of thinking, eminently sensible and advantageous,
is the Rambang, a meeting-place or club where girls and young men come
together at night, for the sake of better acquaintance, prior to entering
into matrimony. Each village possesses one or more institutions of this
kind, and they are indiscriminately patronised by all well-to-do people,
who recognise the institution as a sound basis on which marriage can be
arranged. The Rambang houses are either in the village itself, or half
way between one village and the next, the young women of one village thus
entering into amicable relations with the young men of the other and
<i>vice vers&acirc;</i>. I visited many of these in company with Shokas, and
found them very interesting. Round a big fire in the centre of the room
men and women sat in couples, spinning wool and chatting merrily, for
everything appeared decorous and cheerful. With the small hours of the
morning, they seemed to become more sentimental, and began singing songs without instrumental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_93" id="Pg_93"></a>[<a href="./images/93.png">93</a>]</span>
accompaniment, the rise and fall of the voices sounding
weird and haunting to a degree. The Shoka men and
women possess soft, musical voices, and the sounds which
they utter are not simply a series of notes emitted through
the throat, but, as it were, the vibration of impressions
coming from the heart, and transmitted by means of their
voices to others. Eastern in its character, the Shoka
music is pleasing to the Western ear, not because it
possesses quick progressions, flourishes, or any elaborate
technicalities, but because it conveys the impression of
reality and feeling. The responsive duets, sung by a
young man and answered by a girl, pleased me most.</p>

<p>All their songs are plaintive, and contain modulations
of the voice so mysteriously charming in effect, and so
good in tone, that they really affect one profoundly.
They only sing when the mood takes them; never with a
view to please others, but always simply to give vent to
their emotions. Their love-songs generally open with a
sentimental recitative, and then change into actual singing,
with frequent modulations from one key into another. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_94" id="Pg_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
time is irregular, and though certain rhythmical peculiarities recur
constantly, yet each performer gives to what he sings so strong a
personality of execution as to make it almost an individual composition.
Any one hearing Shokas sing for the first time would imagine that each
singer was improvising as he went along, but on closer comparison it will
be found that musical phrases, certain favourite passages and modulations
in the voice, constantly recur not only in each song, but in all songs.
They seem all of them based on the same doleful tune, probably a very
ancient one, and only the different time in which it is given, and the
eccentricities of the singer, give it a separate and special character.
One characteristic of Shoka songs&mdash;as of so many other
Oriental tunes&mdash;is that they have no rounded ending, and
this, to my ears, rather spoiled them. A similar abrupt
break is a feature of their dances and their drum-beating.
The song suddenly stops in the middle of the air with a
curious grating sound of the voice, and I could not obtain
any entirely satisfactory explanation of this: the only answer
given me was that the singer could not go on for ever, and
that as long as he stopped it did not matter how he did it.
Further, they considered an abrupt ending most suitable to
music (or dancing), as it immediately brought you back to
your normal state, should your mind have been carried away.
One pleasant feature was that their songs were never sung
in a loud tone of voice, nor did they aim at notes too high
or too low for their voices, but kept themselves well within
their compass.</p>

<p>The only difference between solos given by men, and those
sung by women, was that the former showed more plaintiveness
and sentimentality, and greater mutability of thought,
whereas the latter were more uniform, more lively, and less
imaginative in their representation of feelings. The words
of the love-songs, nearly always <i>impromptu</i>, can hardly be
set down in these pages. From our standard of morality,
and away from their own special surroundings, they might
seem almost lewd, while in their place they certainly did
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_95" id="Pg_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
not impress me as offensive. When singing, the Shokas
usually raise the end of their white shawl or dress, and
hold it by the side
of the head.</p>

<p>Smoking was general, each couple sharing the same pipe. A few burning
sticks of pine stuck in the rough wall formed the only illumination, save
the fire in the centre of the room slowly burning out. Signs of
sleepiness became evident as morning came, and soon they all retired in
couples, and went to sleep in their clothes on a soft layer of straw and
grass. There they slept peacefully in a row, and I retraced my steps to
my diggings amidst a deafening barking of pariah dogs. At these gatherings every
Shoka girl regularly meets with young men, and while she
entertains the idea of selecting among them a suitable partner
for life, she also does a considerable quantity of work with
her spinning-wheel. Eventually, when a couple consider
marriage advisable, the young man, dressed in his best clothes,
proceeds to the house of his intended father-in-law, carrying
with him a pot of <i>ch&ouml;kti</i> (wine), dried fruit, <i>ghur</i> (sweet paste),
<i>miseri</i> (sugar-candy), and grilled grain. If the bridegroom is
considered a suitable match, the parents of the girl receive
the young man with due consideration, and partake heartily
of the food and drink proffered by him. The marriage is
there and then arranged, the bridegroom further disbursing
to the father a sum of not less than five rupees and not
more than one hundred. This is the etiquette of good Shoka
society, and of all people who can afford it, the payment
being called &quot;milk-money,&quot; or money equivalent to the sum
spent by the girl's relations in bringing her up. The marriage
ceremony is simple enough. A cake called <i>Delang</i> is baked,
of which the friends of the two families partake. If either
the bridegroom or bride refuses to eat a share of the cake,
the marriage is broken off; if they both eat some of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_96" id="Pg_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
cake, and later any dissension arises between them, all those
who assisted at the function are called as witnesses that the
marriage took place. Often even this primitive ceremony
of eating cake is dispensed with, and Shoka marriages begin
and continue as happy and faithful unions, without any
special form of service or rite to solemnise the tie.</p>

<p>They not only visit adultery on the guilty man himself
by beating him, but the men proceed <i>en masse</i> to the
house of his parents and denude it of all furniture, stores of
grain, and merchandise. They confiscate the sheep, goats,
yaks, and all their valuable saddles and loads, and present the
whole proceeds to the man whose wife has been seduced&mdash;a
recompense for the shame suffered. Frequently the
unfortunate and innocent relations of the evil-doer are
bound and even beaten to death by the villagers. These
severe measures are resorted to in order to maintain a high
standard of morality and honour, and there is little doubt
that, primitive as these methods may seem, the good results
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_97" id="Pg_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
obtained more than justify them. There are very few
illegitimate births, with the exception of occasional Rambang
children, and their arrival is a matter of such disgrace
that they cannot be looked upon as seriously discrediting
the social value
of the Rambang.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Shokas ascribe death to the departure of the soul from
the body, and to this notion is due the curious reverence
they show for the spirit or memory of their dead.
I witnessed a funeral ceremony quaint enough to deserve
record.</p>

<p>A man had died a painful death, the result of an accident.
His friends were immediately sent for, and the corpse, having
been smeared with butter (<i>ghi</i>), was dressed in his best
clothes. They bent his body double before the rigor set in,
and placed him on a hurriedly constructed wooden hearse.
He was covered with a blue-and-gold embroidered cloth,
and a white one over it. At sunrise, the funeral procession
left the house for the place of cremation. First came a row
of ten women, their heads covered with a long strip of white
cotton cloth, one end of which was tied to the hearse.
Among these were the near relations of the deceased,
including his wife and daughters, crying and wailing the
words, &quot;<i>Oh bajo! Oh bajo!</i>&quot; (Oh father! oh father!), the
rest of them sobbing and making great show of grief. The
deceased having been somewhat of a favourite in Garbyang,
the villagers turned out in force to render him this last tribute,
and they took their place in the procession as it slowly
wound down the cliff towards the river. The hearse was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_99" id="Pg_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
carried by two men, and each male Shoka following bore
a log or bundle of firewood. We reached the Kali. The
body was temporarily laid on the bank of the stream, while
all the men, with heads uncovered, collected large stones and
pieces of wood. With the stones a circular crematory oven,
five feet high, six feet in diameter, with an opening on the side
facing the wind, was erected by the water-side. The wife
and daughters of the departed, with their hoods turned inside
out and with covered faces, squatted down meanwhile by
the hearse, moaning and keeping a small fire alight. When
all preparations were made, the oven being heaped up with
logs of wood, the body was untied from the stretcher and
lifted by two intimates of the departed on to the funeral pile.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>All valuables were removed, his gold earrings, his silver
locket and bracelets; and a large knife was used for some
purpose or other which I could not quite see, except in
slitting the lobes of the corpse's ears to remove his earrings
more quickly. Branches of pine-tree were deposited on the
body, and a large pot of butter was set by its side. A brass
bowl of <i>ch&ouml;kti</i> (wine) was poured on the head, and then, in
profound silence, fire was set to the pile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_100" id="Pg_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
A few white puffs showed that it had caught fire, and then
a dense column of black smoke rose from it, filling the
atmosphere with a sickening smell of singed hair and burning
flesh. The wind blew the smoke towards me, and I was
enveloped in it for some moments, during which I could see
nothing of what was going on, and I felt my eyes smart and
my nostrils fill with the smoke and the stench. Gradually a
tall flame, over twenty feet high, leaked out, consuming the
body and showing me, as the atmosphere cleared, the Shokas
down by the river washing their hands and faces to cleanse
themselves of what they look upon as unclean, the contact
with a corpse. Retracing their steps to the village, the
women cried and moaned, carrying back to the house the
clothes of the deceased and his brass bowls.</p>

<p>Reaching home, it was incumbent on them to provide
lavishly for the amusement of the dead man's soul. A lay
figure crudely constructed of straw and sticks was attired by
them in the clothes of the departed, and covered over with
Indian fabrics embroidered in gold and red and blue, and a
turban was stuck on the head, with a <i>panache</i> made of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_101" id="Pg_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
branch of fir-tree. The <i>Kalih&eacute;</i> was at the side of the image.
When the fire was extinguished, a visit was paid to the cremation
spot by the relatives of the deceased, and such pieces of
bone as the knee-joints, elbows, and the larger vertebr&aelig; of
the spine, usually left undestroyed by the flames, were
collected and deposited inside the clothes of the image.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Wheat, rice, and flour were purchased in large quantities and
cooked to provide food for the multitude of friends who
remained the guests of the family during the whole time
of the funeral. A sheep a day is usually killed and eaten on
such occasions, and cask after cask of <i>ch&ouml;kti</i> (wine), <i>zahn</i> (a
liquor distilled from barley, rice and wheat), and <i>anag</i> (from
fermented grain of various kinds) are emptied by the mourning
crowd. The women folk of the dead man mourned
round the effigy, resting their heads on it, crying and imploring
the beloved one to return to life. Other rows of
women, with their hoods turned inside out in sign of mourning,
danced gracefully in circles round the dressed-up figure,
left the house by one door in the basement, described an
arc in the open, and returned by another door, while men
were dancing a doleful dance outside the house. Beating
of drums went on the whole day&mdash;languid and sad at
moments; excited, violent and rowdy at others, according
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_102" id="Pg_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span>
to the mood of the musicians and the quantity of liquor
consumed by them. On each day of these proceedings,
which lasted for three or four days, rice, baked wheat, and
wine were placed before the effigy, until, when it was assumed
that the soul of the dead had had a sufficiently amusing
time, arrangements were made for its transmigration from
the lay figure into a live sheep or yak. If the deceased
is a man, the animal chosen to represent him is a male;
if a woman, a female; but no ceremony of this sort
follows the cremation of children under ten or twelve. In
the case of the old man whose funeral I witnessed, a sheep
was chosen, instead of the time-hallowed yak, the procuring
of which from Tibet used to be a very costly business. The
use of a sheep for these sacrifices is quite a recent innovation,
brought into fashion by the greatest Shoka trader in
Garbyang, called Gobaria, whose intention it was to put
down the unnecessary waste of these ceremonies; but many
pious Shokas, I was assured, are not satisfied with so small
an offering as a single sheep, and slaughter two or even
more on these occasions.</p>

<p>After several days' dancing and gorging indoors, a crowd
collects, to the sound of the drums, outside the habitation.</p>

The lay figure is from the room transported either directly
outside the dwelling or to some picturesque spot in the
woods. This is generally on the fourth day. Bowls with
food are placed in front of it, and the dancing is begun, to
a curious sentimental strain, with a graceful series of contortions,
by girls and women waving large pieces of white
material. The legs keep time with the arms, and each leg
is alternately bent at the knee until it nearly touches the
ground. The head is inclined to the right or left, and
thrown backwards or forwards according to the beating
of the drum. The circular motion in the dancing begins
first very slowly, and the speed then increases by degrees,
abruptly ending in odd and suggestive postures. During
the intervals of dancing the relatives go round and round
the lay figure, dusting and fanning it with their white
cloths.</p>

<p>In the afternoon the men join the performance, and
though their dancing has practically the same characteristics
and motions as the women's dance, it is usually so much
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_105" id="Pg_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span>
more violent that it almost partakes of the character of a
war-dance. They hold in their right hands a sword, in the
left a circular shield, and some of the younger men show
great skill in the rapid manipulation of their blades, twirling
them round their heads and behind their backs. There are
solos, duets and trios, in which the drummer or drummers
take part, and when the dancing is collective, they head the
procession, contorting their bodies and beating their drums
with a stick on one side and the palm of the hand on the
other.</p>

<p>The whole crowd is constantly regaled by the family with
corn baked with sugar, roasted Indian corn, rice, sweets,
<i>ghur</i> and <i>miseri</i>, when the lay figure is supposed to have
had its fill. While the mob eat, the ladies of the house
return to the effigy with quick beating of the drums, and
again double themselves up in solemn lengthy curtsies.
Perhaps the most interesting, because the most accomplished,
were the solo male dancers, each performer displaying
his own particular genius. The drummer beats his drum
whimsically&mdash;fast and slow alternately, with no rule&mdash;just
as it pleases his fancy, and the dancer always keeps time with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_106" id="Pg_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
him in all his frenzies and eccentricities, so that his movements
are sometimes so slow as to be barely noticeable, and
at others so rapid that his arms and legs can no longer be
distinguished. I happened to witness no less than six
funerals simultaneously in Garbyang, and a collective war-dance
of as many as three hundred men. It went on during
a whole day and the greater part of the following night,
torches and a big bonfire burning.</p>

<p>Eventually, amidst firing of guns, howls, yells and deafening
hissing of the assembled crowd, the animal to be sacrificed
is dragged before the lay figure. Long coloured
ribbons are tied round its horns, and the ends left hanging
by the side of its head. Sandal-wood is burnt under the
beast's nostrils, which is supposed to induce the soul of the
departed to enter and establish itself in the animal. The
clothes, the turban, the shield, the jewellery, are torn from
the figure's back and piled on to the goat, which is now the
impersonation of the deceased. It is fed until it can hold</p>

no more, wine and liquor being poured down its throat,
and large dishes of all possible delicacies being placed before
it. The women relatives devote to it their tenderest affection,
and shed tears over it in the conviction that it holds
the spirit of their lost protector. Stuffed with food, and
stupefied by the alcohol, the beast submits, emotionless and
immovable, to the wild caresses, prayers, and salaams
showered on it. Again the hissing, whistling and yelling
begin, and a rush is made for the animal, which is
seized by the horns, the neck, the tail, wherever it can be
caught hold of, and dragged, pushed, beaten, and at last
chased out of the village, but not until after the clothes,
shield, sword, turban, and ornaments have been torn from its
back. It is eventually handed over to the Hunyas or Jumlis
or Humlis, who on these occasions benefit by the simplicity
and superstition of the Shokas, and who throw it down, rip
the body open, and pull out the heart, or twist it in the
inside with a jerk that kills instantly. This method applies
to sheep or goat.</p>

When a yak is sacrificed, very much the same rites take place up to the
moment when the lay figure is deprived of its clothing and the yak
invested with it. It is similarly beaten and dragged about, and left on
the top of some mountain, the crowd calling after it, &quot;Go! go! We
have feasted, f&ecirc;ted and fed you. We have done all in our power for
your welfare. We cannot do more! Go now!&quot; With this the yak, with
the soul that has been driven into it, is left to its own devices, and as
soon as the Shokas have departed, is driven by the Tibetans over a
precipice, it being against their faith to draw blood from a yak. In the
fatal leap the animal is smashed to pieces, and the Tibetans, collecting
the remains, gorge themselves with the prized meat of their cherished
yak.</p>

<p>As a mark of reverence the Shoka men remove their caps
not only while following the corpse to cremation, but also
during the feasting, the male relatives themselves even
shaving their heads; and this practice is occasionally
extended to the whole male community in the case of a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_110" id="Pg_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
particularly respected villager dying. The women remove
their jewellery, and, as already noted, turn their hoods inside
out.</p>

<p>When all is over, some restitution of his property is made
to the dead, and odd articles, such as brass bowls or a gun
or a shield or sword, are placed in a sacred cave, which
none dare desecrate by entering to remove anything. These
caves are high up on the mountain-sides, and are said to be
full of sacred offerings, which have accumulated there in
the centuries.</p>

<p>I expressed the wish to see the cave on the mountain side
above Garbyang, but the natives politely asked me not to do
so, as the visit of a stranger to this sacred spot might bring
misfortune on the Shoka living community. Therefore I
abstained from going rather than cause unpleasantness.</p>

<h5>Touching Shoka farewell&mdash;Feelings curiously expressed&mdash;Sobs

father and mother&mdash;Kachi and Dola the worse for drink&mdash;Anxious
moments&mdash;The bridge destroyed.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> day of my departure came. It was after dark. Outside my dwelling a
crowd of Shokas had assembled. I bade farewell to my host Zeheram and to
his wife and children, who with tears in their eyes wished me God-speed.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Kachi and his Relations</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>&quot;Salaam, sahib,
salaam!&quot; repeated Zeheram, sobbing and bringing
his hand respectfully to his forehead. &quot;You know, sahib,
that a horse goes to a horse, a tiger to a tiger, a yak to
a yak, and a man to a man. A man's house is another
man's house, no matter whether the colour of our skin
differs or not. Therefore I thank Heaven that you have
accepted shelter under my humble roof. You must have
been uncomfortable, for all you sahibs are rich and accustomed
to luxury. I am only a trader and a cultivator.
I am poor, but I possess a heart. You, unlike other sahibs,
have always spoken kindly to me and to all of us Shokas.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_112" id="Pg_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
We feel that you are our brother. You have given us
presents, but we needed them not. The only present we
wish for is that, when you reach the end of your perilous
journey, you will send us a message that you are well. We
will all pray day and night for you. Our hearts are sore at
your leaving us.&quot;</p>

<p>This from the rough old boy, whom I had got really to
like, was touching, and I told him I hoped I might some day
be able to repay him for his kindness. When I descended
the steps there was quite a crowd in the yard. Every one
wished to bid me farewell. The men took my right hand
in both theirs and brought it up to their foreheads, muttering
words of grief at my leaving. The women gently caressed
my face and bade me &quot;<i>Niku tza</i>&quot; (&quot;Go well,&quot; &quot;Farewell&quot;).
These are the Shoka fashions of taking leave of friends who
are departing for distant lands.</p>

<p>Led by the hand by a really grieving company, I moved
towards the narrow, steep descent to the Chongur bridge,
cut into the slope of the high cliffs of clay. On the way I
called at Kachi's house, but he had gone ahead. A more
mournful procession could not be imagined. The faint rays
of a new moon gave an added melancholy to the scene,
and that peculiarly impressive sound of sad steps, if I may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_113" id="Pg_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span>
thus express the pathetic cadence of people's gait when
afflicted, made me feel as if I were attending my own funeral.
I begged them to return to their homes, and one after the
other they came to embrace my feet and to hold my
fingers. Then, hiding their faces in the palms of their
hands, they one by one made their way up the grey track
cut into the lofty cliff, and like phantoms, gradually becoming
smaller and smaller, vanished in the distance. Still
some twenty or thirty insisted on escorting me down to the
stream. Farther on I came upon the excited figure of an
old woman tearing her hair and crying pitifully. She threw
herself at my feet, imploring me to take care of her son.
It was Kachi's distressed mother. I comforted her as best
I could, and also the desolate father (good old Junia), who
was there with tears streaming down his cheeks, to bid me
an affectionate farewell.</p>

<p>&quot;Where is your son?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You will find him a little farther down, sahib.&quot;</p>

<p>I did&mdash;together with four other people lying on the ground
all in a heap. One of them who tried to stand up, called out:
&quot;Kachi, get up, here is the sahib,&quot; and then collapsed again
on the top of the others. Neither Kachi nor the others gave
any sign of life, and when I spoke to them I discovered
that they were in a state of hopeless intoxication, arm-in-arm
as they had fallen and slept.</p>

<p>By the side of Kachi was Dola, his uncle, supposed to be
employed by me in the quadruple capacity of interpreter,
carrier, Kachi's valet, and cook, in which latter art, after Shoka
fashion, he was quite an adept, his fame having spread all
over Bias. He was, therefore, a treasure not lightly to be
abandoned, and yet, now that I wanted to act quickly and
decisively, I had to weigh whether I should proceed with
two of the most important characters in my play disabled.
Should I, hampered by these semi-corpses, be able to pass
unseen the watchful Tibetan guard at the Chongur bridge,
only a few hundred yards farther on? I decided to try.
Seizing one on each side under their arm-pits, I supported
them and kept them erect. It was no easy job, and I felt
our speed increase at every step as I moved with my staggering
mates down the steep and slippery track. We
reached the bottom of the hill at a breakneck rate, and as
the track was narrow along the water's edge, it was a wonder
that we did not all three of us land in the river. As it was,
in coming suddenly to a stop, my two men utterly collapsed
again, and I was so exhausted that I had to sit down
and rest.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_114" id="Pg_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
Kachi Ram had a lucid interval. He gazed round and
saw me for the first time that night.</p>

<p>&quot;Sahib!&quot; he exclaimed, with long pauses between each
word, &quot;I am drunk!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is quite true,&quot; said I.</p>

<p>&quot;We Shokas have this bad habit,&quot; he continued. &quot;I had
to drink <i>ch&ouml;kti</i> with all my relations and friends prior to
leaving for this long journey. They would have been
offended if I had not divided with each a cup of wine. I
now see everything go round. Please put my head into
cold water. Oh! the moon is jumping about, and is now
under my feet!&quot;</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I complied with his request, and gave both his head and
Dola's a good ducking in the freezing Kali River.</p>

<p>This had the unfortunate effect of sending them to sleep
so soundly that I thought they would never wake again.
Some of the sober Shokas offered to carry the two helpless
men on their backs. We were wasting valuable time and
the sky was getting clouded. When the moon had disappeared
behind the high mountain, I went ahead to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_115" id="Pg_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
reconnoitre. All was darkness but for the glimmer of a
brilliant star here and there in the sky. I crawled to the
bridge and listened. Not a sound, not a light on the opposite
bank. All was silence, that dead silence of nature and
human life asleep. I stopped on the bridge. This structure
spans the river, a huge boulder in the centre of the
stream serving as a pillar, and forms, in fact, two separate
bridges joined on the opposite sides of this central boulder.
I walked cautiously across the first portion, stood to listen
again on the rock dividing the foaming waters, and tried to
penetrate the obscurity. There was not a soul to be seen,
nor a sound to be heard. I went over the rock and proceeded
towards the second half of the bridge, when I found
to my horror that this second half of the bridge had been
cut down. The entire section had collapsed, and with the
exception of a long beam still swinging to and fro with one
end in the turbid stream, and a plank or two, the whole
material had been washed away.</p>

<p>I returned to my men.</p>

<p>&quot;We must continue our way on this side of the river,&quot; I
whispered to them. &quot;The Tibetans have destroyed the
bridge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The track is traced,&quot; they replied, &quot;but it is impassable
at night.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind; we must go. Come.&quot; And I headed the
silent procession.</p>

<p>We went about a mile. Yet another dilemma. Kachi
and Dola were still fast asleep. The others, tired and worn
out with the fatigue of carrying them, wished to turn back.
The sky was now clouded all over and rain was coming on.</p>

<p>I felt that it was useless to persist. Having seen the two
drunken creatures laid flat under a shed, and well covered
with blankets, I therefore returned to Garbyang, with the
intention of making a fresh start shortly before sunrise,
when the drunkards would probably be fit to walk by themselves,
and found shelter under the ever hospitable roof of

<h5>A dangerous track&mdash;Perilous passage&mdash;A curious bridge over
a precipice&mdash;Pathetic Shoka custom&mdash;Small misadventures&mdash;A
grand reception&mdash;Tea for all tastes.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">At 4 a.m.</span>, before the sun rose, I made a fresh and hurried
start. I proceeded quickly to the spot where I had left the
two drunken men. They had gone ahead.</p>

<p>Indeed the track was a bad and dangerous one, overhanging
precipices, and hardly wide enough to give standing
room upon it. We came to a spot where the narrow path
stopped. There was before us a perpendicular rock descending
straight as a wall to the Kali River. The corrosive
action of dripping water and melting snow, of which last
there seemed to be a thick layer higher above on the summit
of the cliff, had worn the face of the rock quite smooth.
The distance across this vertical wall-like ravine was not
more than forty or fifty feet. On the other side of it the
narrow track began again.</p>

<p>Owing to this and other dangerous places, this route is
but very seldom used by the natives or by any one else.
The road generally taken is on the opposite side of the Kali
River, in Nepal territory. Nevertheless, a few Shokas
possess bits of land on this bank of the stream, and it was
by them that, in order to surmount the obstacle before
which I now stood, the following expedient was devised in
former years.</p>

<p>By letting down a man from above with ropes they succeeded
in making two rows of small hollows in the rock,
along two parallel horizontal lines, the higher of which was
about six feet or so above the lower. The holes were dug
at intervals of three or four feet along each line, the upper
ones to be caught on by one's hands, the lower ones to</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_118" id="Pg_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>
support one's feet, and none of the cavities are deeper than
a few inches.</p>

<p>The transit seemed dangerous at any time, and impossible
just then, because the drizzling rain which had set in
had wetted the rock and made it as slippery as glass, but I
realised that the thing had to be risked, and at any cost.
With an affected air of assurance, I therefore took off my
shoes and went ahead.</p>

<p>I could not look about me, for I clung with my body to
the wall, feeling my way with my toes and fingers. The
cavities were, as a matter of fact, so shallow that progress
was slow and troublesome. When the toes of the right limb
seemed firmly planted in a receptacle, the right arm was
made to slide along the rock until the fingers had obtained
a firm grip in the cavity directly above the one in which the
toes were. Then the entire body had to be shifted from left
to right, bringing the left foot and hand close to the right
extremities and suspending one's weight on the former, so
as to render the right foot and arm ready to make the next
move forward, and so on, till I reached the other side and
alighted upon the narrow track, which was itself only five or
six inches wide. Chanden Sing having tied his shoes and
mine over his shoulders, proceeded bare-footed on the same
hazardous enterprise. With none of the excitement of
personal danger, the moments of apprehension while he
groped his way with toes and fingers, half paralysed with
cold and fear, were to me worse even than those of my own
passage. But he too got across safe and sound, and after
that the rest was comparatively easy.</p>

<p>It was necessary now to look out for signs of the two
men, Kachi and Dola, who had preceded us. I was glad to
find a little farther on fresh footmarks, undoubtedly those
of the two Shokas. The track still ascended and descended
nearly all along precipitous cliffs, and was everywhere
dangerously narrow, with here and there bits on shaky crowbars.
At one spot the rugged formation of the cliff forced
one suddenly to ascend to its very top and cross (on all-fours)
a rude kind of bridge made of branches of trees
spanned not horizontally, but at an angle of sixty degrees over
a precipice of several hundred feet. I found a white thread
of wool laid over this primitive structure, in accordance
with the custom of the Shokas at the death of relatives or
friends away from their native village. The soul is supposed
to migrate during the dark hours of the night and to return
to the birthplace of the deceased, these white threads showing
the way at dangerous places on the road.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_119" id="Pg_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>Having lost the track more than once, we found ourselves
down at the edge of the Kali and compelled to climb up
some three hundred feet over sand and rolling stones to
regain the path.</p>

<p>We arrived at last at Nabi. There I found my loads safe
and sound, having got here by the better track on the Nepalese
side previously to the Chongur bridge being destroyed
by the Tibetans, also Kachi and Dola, who had got over and
recovered from their drink. To make up, perhaps, for their
past misbehaviour, and probably to make me overlook or forget
it, they seemed to have induced the natives to welcome
me with particular cordiality. I was invited by them, with
much show of hospitality, to spend the night in the village.</p>

<p>I was led with some ceremony to a primitive sort of
ladder with very roughly carved steps, and shoved, with help
from above and below, on to a flat mud roof. Here a tent
had been pitched, the floor of which was covered with mats
and rugs for me to rest on. I no sooner laid myself down
than a string of men, women and children arrived, carrying
bowls with a particularly sumptuous meal of rice, <i>dhal</i>,
meat, <i>balab</i> (or boiled buckwheat leaves), curd, milk, broiled
corn with sugar, <i>chapatis</i>, <i>shale</i>, sweets, native wine and
liquor.</p>

<p>During the meal, tea was served in all sorts of fashions.
There was Chinese tea and Indian tea, tea boiled with sugar
and tea without it, tea with milk, and tea with butter and
salt in it, pale tea and dark tea, sweet tea and bitter tea&mdash;in
fact, tea until I&mdash;devoted as I am to it&mdash;wished that no tea-leaf
had ever been picked and stewed in boiling water.</p>

<h5>Dr. Wilson joins my expedition for a few marches&mdash;What misdeeds
a photographic camera can do&mdash;Weighing, dividing,
and packing provisions&mdash;Two extra men wanted&mdash;The last
friendly faces.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> examining a young woman who had badly injured
and partly fractured a central vertebra of the spine, when
Dr. Wilson turned up and gave the poor wretch the little
relief possible in her condition, for which she had hoped in
vain from me. He was welcome to me for many reasons
besides the pleasure of being in his company. He had
offered to join my expedition for a few marches into
Tibet, and I was glad indeed to have him with me. We
pushed on as soon as possible over the road between Nabi
and Kuti, which I have already described. Our journey
was quite uneventful, and the snow-bridges and snow-fields,
so troublesome when I had first taken this road, had
melted and altogether disappeared. Even at Nabi little
happened. But I must just mention the following incident
as illustrative of the curious suspicion and dislike I found
everywhere of the photographic apparatus I carried with
me.</p>

<p>I was on the point of leaving the place when a handsome
Tibetan woman, whom I had not previously noticed,
accosted me with hysterical sobs&mdash;inarticulate, but conveying
a very clear impression of suffering.</p>

<p>&quot;You have killed my child, and now you will kill my
husband,&quot; she complained, when she was able to talk; and
I then discovered that I had on my previous visit to Nabi
taken a snap-shot at a child perched on the top of a very
heavy load that happened to be carried on the woman's back
through my camp, and that when she complained I had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_121" id="Pg_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
appeased her, in the usual way, with a coin. She had conveyed
her load to Kuti, and had slipped, on her way back,
with her child&mdash;at a spot not far from where I had had my
slide&mdash;but, less fortunate than myself, had rolled right into
the foaming stream. She managed to cling to the rock and
was eventually saved, but the infant was washed from rock
to rock by the current, and disappeared under a snow
tunnel.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sahib!&quot; cried the woman, &quot;if you had not before
we started looked at us through <i>the eyes</i> (the twin lenses) of
your <i>black box</i> (the photographic camera), I should not
have lost my baby.&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">The Photograph that Caused the Child's Death</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>&quot;And how about your husband?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, you will kill him too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I don't know your husband. Anyhow, I promise
not to look at him with these eyes.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is not that, sahib, but he is coming with you to
Tibet. He is carrying one of your loads. You will all be
killed.&quot;</p>

<p>She pointed him out to me&mdash;one of the strongest
among the men I had, and the most anxious to accompany
me. He was too good to lose, and I was certainly
unwilling to renounce my claim to him on account of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_122" id="Pg_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
good woman's tears. So I consoled her as best I could;
promised to take good care of him, and under no circumstances
to photograph him.</p>

<p>At Kuti, Dr. Wilson and I were busy for several hours
weighing, dividing and packing in equal loads the provisions
I had purchased: fourteen <i>munds</i> in all (1120 lbs.) of flour,
rice, red sugar (<i>ghur</i>), salt, red pepper (32 lbs.), <i>dhal, miseri</i>
(lump sugar), <i>ghi</i> (butter), and a large quantity of <i>satoo</i>
(oatmeal), and broiled corn. There were, in addition, the
preserved and tinned provisions which I had brought with
me from London.</p>

<p>To give my carriers no cause for complaint, I allowed
them to choose their own shoes, blankets, &amp;c., and I did all
in my power to humour them, because the loads threatened
to be excessively heavy. In fact, I found that, even after
dispensing with everything but what was absolutely essential,
there was still ample to carry for at least two strong
men. Every available Shoka had joined the party, and no
inducement that I could offer brought me more volunteers.
I was very unwilling to delay, and I was on the point of
subdividing among the men I already had the two extra
loads, when two stray shepherds turned up, half famished
and naked, with long unkempt heads of hair, and only a
coral necklace and a silver bangle by way of clothing. I
quickly secured them, and although one was really only
a boy, I decided to trust to luck and take Dr. Wilson's
assurance that he looked tough enough and would be
useful.</p>

<p>This brought my little force up to thirty strong, and now
I was ready to start.</p>

<h5>The Kuti Castle&mdash;Under way&mdash;Our first disaster&mdash;A cheerful
and a sulky coolie&mdash;Mansing&mdash;A brigand&mdash;A strange medley
of followers&mdash;A character&mdash;Tailoring&mdash;Fields of stones&mdash;Troublesome
rivers&mdash;The Jolinkan or Lebung Pass&mdash;Sense of
humour&mdash;Pleased with small comforts.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> leaving Kuti, I went to see the curious and
ancient castle perched on a small hill about three hundred
yards south of the village. It is now in ruins, with the
exception of a quadrangular tower called by the natives the
Kuti Ker, but the foundations of the whole structure can
still be plainly seen. I made a plan, which is here reproduced,
as it may be of arch&aelig;ological interest. The natives could
give me no information regarding it, except that it was once
a king's palace strongly fortified. A small house of several
rooms by the side of the tower is said to have been the
blacksmith's shop in which the arrowheads and swords for
the king's soldiers were made. The tower is four yards square
at its base, and built of stone. Judging by its shape and
construction, and the curious windows, I am inclined to
attribute this castle to Tibetan workmanship, for identical
towers are seen in Tibet, even at Taklakot. The windows,
or rather slits, on each floor of the tower were six inches
square; those in the blacksmith's house were considerably
larger. There were outer walls for the defence of the fort at
places where the castle would have been most accessible.
Quantities of stones piled up in heaps probably served as
ammunition for the defenders of the fortress in centuries
gone by.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_124" id="Pg_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
When I returned to camp all was ready, and after endless
trouble with some of my men, who were already
uncertain as to whether they would accompany me on my
journey or not, I eventually got under way in the afternoon.
The Kuti village is the highest in Bias, being situated at an
elevation of 12,920 feet.</p>

<p>The track was now comparatively free from snow and ice
except here and there, where we had to cross extensive
slopes covered with snow. On one of these we had our
first disaster. A coolie fell who carried in his hand a
large pot containing butter. He fortunately did not slide
far down, but we had the bitter disappointment of seeing
our precious pot roll into the water and disappear for
ever. We camped at an elevation of 13,050 feet. Late in
the evening, as my men were collecting wood to keep up a
huge fire round which we sat, my two coolies, who had
remained at Kuti with instructions to follow, arrived with
their respective loads. They were two strange characters.
The one with a coral necklace was mournful and sulky, the
other lively and talkative. They professed to be by caste
Rajiputs.</p>

<p>&quot;You see,&quot; exclaimed the cheerful coolie, &quot;I am small,
but I fear nothing. When we cross into Tibet I shall go
ahead with a pointed stick and clear all the Tibetans away. I
am not afraid of them. I am ready to fight the whole world.&quot;</p>

<p>Knowing the value of this sort of talk on the part of
natives, I shut him up and sent him away to fetch wood.
The sulky fellow interested me more. He seldom uttered a
word, and when he did he never spoke pleasantly; he was
apparently immersed in deep thought, from which it seemed
a great effort to draw his mind away. He looked painfully
ill. Motionless and speechless, he would stare at a fixed
point as if in a trance. His features were peculiarly refined
and regular, but his skin had that ghastly shiny
whitish tinge so peculiar to lepers. I waited for an
opportunity to examine his hands, on which he sat to
keep them warm. It is there, in the contracted or dropping
off fingers, that one finds the first certain symptoms
of that most terrible of all diseases, leprosy. I asked the
man to come and sit nearer the blazing fire. He came and
stretched out his open palms towards the flickering flame.
Alas! my suspicions were but too correct. His fingers,
distorted and contracted, with the skin sore at the joints,
were sad and certain proof. I examined his feet and found
the same symptoms there also.</p>

<p>&quot;What is your name?&quot; I inquired of him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_125" id="Pg_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.jpg">125</a>]</span></p>

<p>&quot;Mansing,&quot; he said drily, becoming immediately again
absorbed in one of his reveries.</p>

<p>The crackling fire was dying down, when a stalwart
Tibetan suddenly appeared bent low under the heavy weight
of a huge tree-trunk which he was carrying on his back.
He approached and threw the wood on the fire.</p>

<p>Here was another character! As strong as an ox, this servant of mine had
queer antecedents. He was at one time a well-known bandit in the
neighbourhood of Lhassa. He was said to have taken many lives, and,
finding his own in danger in his country, had come to settle on our side
of the border, marrying different wives, whom he constantly beat and in
turn banished from under his roof. It was owing to his latest family
squabble that he came into my employ; his abnormal strength, valuable for
carrying loads, was to me his only recommendation. In camp he went by the
name of <i>Daku</i>, &quot;the brigand.&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter">Mansing the Leper showing his Hands</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>In looking round to inspect my other followers, with
whom I had hardly yet got acquainted, I was amused and
interested at the strange medley of creatures forming my
band. There were Humlis and Jumlis with their luxuriant
black hair tied into small tresses and a top-knot over the
head, like the Coreans. There were Tibetans, Shokas
of Bias, Rongbas, Nepalese, Rajiputs and Totolas, also a
Brahmin, two native Christians and a Johari. Then Dr.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_127" id="Pg_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
Wilson. What a collection! What a chaos of languages
and dialects!</p>

<p>An amusing feature of this odd crowd was that each
particular caste looked down upon all the others. This
from the very beginning occasioned separation during mealtime,
and the camp was lively with as many burning fires in
as many sheltered spots as there were castes of men
following me. I was glad of this, as it seemed a sort of
guarantee that they would never all join together to conspire
against me.</p>

<p>Poor Mansing, the leper, was shivering with cold. He
had been unable to purchase himself a blanket and shoes at
Kuti. He had spent the money in tobacco instead. Dr.
Wilson and I took pity upon him. The long evening was
still before us, so I got out the cloth I had purchased at
Kuti, and with scissors and needle we began to cut and sew
a new set of garments for the poor wretch. The Doctor
did the cutting and I the sewing. I cannot boast that a
professional tailor would not have turned out a better fit,
but for all general purposes the newly-made clothes
answered well enough. There was only one inconvenience
in the single-breasted jacket. I had no buttons, and was
therefore compelled to sew the coat on the man himself.
It thus remained a fixture, and not only looked all right, but&mdash;which
was our chief object&mdash;kept him warm.</p>

<p>We left camp at 5.30 the following morning. High
mountains rose on either side of us, and we followed the
Kuti River flowing here from West to East. At an elevation
of 13,980 feet we crossed the Bitroguare River. On the
other side of the Kuti River were high perpendicular cliffs
of a vividly red-coloured rock with blue horizontal stratifications,
and towering over them a succession of very
pointed peaks.</p>

<p>The action of ice on the rock was noticeable everywhere.
As we went farther we came upon extensive fields of stones
and boulders brought down from the higher peaks by the ice,
and in some places we found actual <i>moraines</i>. To our left
stood a gigantic wall of stone like a natural impregnable
fortress. Travelling in a direction of 320&deg; (b.m.), and at
elevations of 13,900 feet, 14,200 feet, 14,300 feet, we waded
through three tributaries of the Kuti; then we came to a
foaming, rapid and deep river which we had great difficulty
in crossing. It was getting towards the middle of the day,
and the stream, fed by the snows melting under the hot sun,
was rising from moment to moment. Two of my coolies
whom I first sent in reached the middle, where the water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_128" id="Pg_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
came up to their chins. They lost their footing and were
temporarily helpless, and in some danger of being swamped,
the loads which they carried on their heads being partly
spoiled when we succeeded in recovering them. The other
men got frightened by the time they were ready to cross.
The river had risen so high that it was impossible to get to
the other side except by swimming, and this was out of the
question, on account of the loads. We therefore had to
follow the stream upwards for about a mile, when fortunately
we found a somewhat dangerous, yet passable, snow bridge,
over which the remainder of my men and goods effected a
crossing in safety. We returned to our course on the Kuti,
still passing between high, rugged mountains along an
undulating plain averaging about 400 yards wide. Though
at comparatively high elevations, there were large patches
of brightly coloured flowers&mdash;red, violet, white and vivid
yellow&mdash;which gave to the landscape a picturesque and
constantly changing effect.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">The Jolinkan or Lebung Pass</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>On reaching a small pass, 14,750 feet, the path branched
to Darma by the Jolinkan towards bearings 260&deg;, and over
the Lebung Pass. It is really only a goat track, exceedingly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_129" id="Pg_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
difficult and fatiguing, except in the month of August, when
there is only a small quantity of snow, and it leads to the
Dholi River about half a mile south of Khumling.</p>

<p>The Jolinkan River, rising from the snow field to the East
of the Lebung or Jolinkan Pass, had now to be crossed.
The stalwart dacoit, ever ready to make himself useful, conveyed
his load across, and lifting me like a feather on to his
back, saved me from plunging higher than my waist into the
bitterly cold water, whereas he was covered up to his neck.
The course of the Kuti turns now to 330&deg; (b.m.). Going
up and down small barren hills, round the foot of high
mountains, we attained an altitude of 15,000 feet. Here,
to the left of the track, and eighty feet above it, is a small
and beautiful lake 500 yards long and 400 wide. Its
waters, in which the high snowy peaks round it are reflected
as in a silver mirror, find an outlet in a short but most
precipitous river flowing with tremendous force into the
Kuti. Soon after leaving this lake we came upon another
small sheet of water, near which were thirteen peculiar piles
or columns of stones, each one having been erected by the
first Tibetan or Shoka who crossed the pass during the
summer. A similar erection could also be seen perched on a
large rock jutting out from the water of the larger lake.
Though the sun was fast going down behind the mountains
to the west, we pressed on, trying to make as much headway
as we could towards the perpetual snows. We still travelled
over undulating ground, and the marching was not heavy
or difficult, save for the freezingly cold and very rapid
streams we had to wade through. It was all we could do to
get warm again after having been immersed in one, and
before we had ceased shivering we had to wade through the
next, and yet the next, so that one's chilliness increased, and
the constant discomfort of cold became very trying. Much
discontent prevailed among my carriers over the very long
march, as their feet were numbed with cold. They nearly
mutinied when I would not let them stop at a camp they had
selected, but ordered them to proceed farther. A mile and a
half from the point they had favoured, we overlooked a large,
flat basin of stones and gravel, about half a mile wide and
three-quarters of a mile long, which had the appearance of
having formerly been a lake. It was surrounded by high
snowy peaks, and its bed lay at an altitude of 15,400 feet. It
seemed as if the immense quantity of stones and pebbles
carried by the river feeding it had raised its bed until it had
caused the water to flow into the Kuti. When I saw it,
the river formed an extensive delta with as many as twelve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_130" id="Pg_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
arms, joining again within the basin into one single stream
before throwing itself into the Kuti. Naturally we selected
the wider expanse of water to ford, assuming that it
would be shallower than the narrow ones. Once more that
day I took off my lower garments and entered the cold
water. It came direct from the snows, and its temperature
was slightly above freezing-point. The sun had gone down,
and there was a piercing wind. My feet, as I went in and
out of the numerous branches of the stream, became so cold
that I could hardly stand for the stinging pain; moreover,
treading on sharp-edged stones under the water and knocking
my frozen toes against them was at first very painful,
but after a time they got so frozen that, though at each step
the soles of my feet and toes were cut and bruised, I suffered
no actual pain until after crossing five or six arms of the
delta. Unable to balance myself any longer, I struggled as
best I could out of the water and rubbed my feet violently,
until slowly, and with intense pain, they came back to life.</p>

<p>It is curious how a little sense of humour helps on such
occasions. To an onlooker not suffering as we were, the
sight of our party crossing that dreadful delta would have
been curious. The expression of disgust on all my men's
faces, not to speak of my own, could not but have caused
merriment. We carried our footgear on our shoulders;
we struggled, stumbled, and splashed in the greenish water,
and now one, then another, fell helpless through frostbite
on some island or other, until we were all disabled, and
still only half-way through. In spite of our condition, worn
out as we were, the soles and sides of our feet badly cut
and bleeding, my men, so sulky at having been firmly baulked
in their wishes, became quite good-natured and amusing
when I chaffed them over their present troubles, and they
saw that I was in the same plight. After endless rubbing,
we restored a certain amount of circulation to our lower
limbs, and proceeded to cross the next six arms of the delta.
When, after an hour or longer of suffering, we were at last
able to put on our footgear, we felt the happiness which
comes from the knowledge of difficulties overcome. Never
can I forget the great joy arising from what may seem a
small comfort&mdash;a warm pair of socks! As I write these
lines I live over again the particular pleasure of gently drawing
them on, and it is impressed for ever on my mind as a
fitting reward for the hardships I had put up with.</p>

<p>We pitched our tents in a sheltered narrow valley to the
North-West of the large basin. Altitude, 15,400 feet. Thermometer:

<h5>Want of fuel&mdash;Cooking under difficulty&mdash;Mansing lost and
found&mdash;Saved from summary justice&mdash;Tibetan visitors&mdash;We
purchase sheep&mdash;The snow-line&mdash;Cold streams&mdash;The petrified
<i>chapati</i> and human hand.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the main drawbacks of travelling at these great altitudes
was the want of vegetable fuel. There was not a tree,
not a shrub to be seen near our camp. Nature wore her most
desolate and barren look. Failing wood, my men dispersed
to collect and bring in the dry dung of yak, pony and sheep
to serve as fuel. Kindling this was no easy matter, box
after box of matches was quickly used, and our collective
lung power severely drawn upon in fanning the unwilling
sparks into a flame only a few inches high. Upon this
meagre fire we attempted to cook our food and boil our
water (a trying process at such an altitude), keeping our
own circulation fairly normal by constantly required efforts.
The cuisine that night was not of the usual excellence, and
did but little credit to the cook. We had to eat everything
half-cooked, or, to be accurate, almost altogether uncooked.
The night was a bitterly cold one, with a heavy fall of
snow. When we rose in the morning it lay quite two feet
deep around us, and the glare was painful to the eyes. I
mustered my men. Mansing was missing. He had not
arrived the previous night, and there was no sign of the
man I had sent in search of him. I was anxious not only
from my personal interest in his load (the fellow carried a
load of flour, salt, pepper, and five pounds of butter), but I
was afraid that the poor leper might himself have been
washed away in one of the dangerous streams. Even if this
fear were groundless, he must, I felt, have suffered terribly
from the cold with no shelter and no fire. Bijesing, who
had gone in search of him, had eaten some food before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_132" id="Pg_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
starting, and had taken blankets with him in case he could
not return to camp during the night.</p>

<p>It was long after sunrise when, with the aid of my telescope,
I discovered the two men coming towards us. They
arrived an hour or so later. Mansing had been found
sound asleep, several miles back, lying by the side of the
empty butter-pot, the contents of which he had devoured.
The discovery of this misdeed caused the greatest indignation
in camp, for fatty matter and butter were much cherished
by the natives, as being warmth-producing, when going over
these cold passes. He was nearly the victim of summary
justice at the hands of my angry men, and it was only
with trouble that I rescued him from their clutches. To
prevent a recurrence of the offence, I ordered the culprit
to carry in future a heavy load of photographic plates and
instruments, which I thought would not prove quite so
appetising.</p>

<p>Before starting I took my usual bath in the cold stream
and rubbed myself all over with snow. I found this very
invigorating, and when the reaction came I experienced a
delightful glow of warmth, notwithstanding the thin clothes
I was wearing.</p>

<p>While we were camping, a flock of some six hundred
sheep appeared, and with them some Tibetans. As I had
put up my Tibetan tent, they had made for it, expecting
to find some of their own countrymen, and their embarrassment
was amusing when they found themselves
face to face with Dr. Wilson and myself. Hurriedly
removing their fur caps, they laid them upon the
ground and made a comical jerky curtsey, as if their
heads and knees moved by means of a spring. They
put out their tongues full length and kept them so until I
made signs that they could draw them back, as I wanted
them to answer some questions. This unexpected meeting
with us frightened them greatly; they were trembling all
over with fear, and after getting as much information out
of them as they seemed to possess, I took advantage of
the opportunity to buy some of their fattest sheep. When
the money was paid there was a further display of furred
tongues, and more grand salaams ere they departed, while
all hands on our side were busy trying to prevent our
newly purchased animals from rejoining the flock moving
away from us. On our next march these animals proved a
great trouble, and we had to drag them the greater part
of the way. Kachi, who had been entrusted with a very
recalcitrant and strong beast, which I had specially pro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_133" id="Pg_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>mised
my men for their dinner if they made a long march
that day, found himself discomfited when he saw that the
sheep had freed its head from the cord with which he was
dragging it, and was cantering away full speed in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Camping in Snow</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Now, it is well known that at considerable
altitudes running is a very painful operation for
human beings, the rarified air making the effect of such
exertion almost suffocating. Yet Kachi, having over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_134" id="Pg_134"></a>[<a href="./images/134.png">134</a>]</span>come
his first surprise, was soon chasing the escaped beast,
and, urged by the cheers and shouts of my other men, who
seemed much concerned over this new calamity, he succeeded,
after an exciting chase, in capturing it by its tail,
a feat easier to describe than to accomplish, for Tibetan
sheep have very short stumpy tails. Kachi fell to the ground
exhausted, but he held fast with both hands to his capture,
and eventually the animal was secured with ropes. This was
the sort of minor trouble with which we had to contend at
almost every turn during our journey, and although it may
appear trivial, it was exasperating enough at the time.</p>

<p>On fairly undulating ground we gradually rose to a pass
15,580 feet high; then traversing a wide flat land, we
followed the Kuti River with its high snowy mountains to
the West and East. The snow-line was at 16,000 feet; the
snow below this level melts daily, except in a few shaded
places. Red and white flowers were still to be seen, though
not in such quantities as lower down, and I saw enamoured
couples of small black and white butterflies.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>After a while there was yet another bitterly cold stream
to ford; two small lakes to skirt; three more deep rivers
to wade, with cold water from the snows up to our chests,
and then we had to make the best way we could through
a large field of rocks and stones showing strong indications
of iron, my compasses being at once affected, and
becoming for a time quite unreliable owing to the
deviation. A curious flat circular stone, resting on
the top of others, was pointed out to me as a
wonder; the accepted legend of the Shokas being that,
centuries ago, one of their countrymen halted by the
side of this rock, and having baked a <i>chapati</i>, laid it upon
the rock, proceeding to make others, when to his great
astonishment, on raising his hand to take his first <i>chapati</i>, he
found it had turned into solid stone, and had furthermore
assumed gigantic proportions. A few feet farther on I was
pointed out another wonder, a great human hand (as the
Tibetans and Shokas call it), which is supposed to
have belonged to the maker of the <i>chapati</i>. Not being
satisfied with his first experience, he laid his hand on the
rock, and there it remained, petrified, and in this case also,
increasing tenfold in size. I could see, with some stretch
of the imagination, a certain resemblance to an enormous
human hand, but the thing required more faith than
observation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_135" id="Pg_135"></a>[<a href="./images/135.png">135</a>]</span>
Mile after mile we marched over sharp stones, wading
through a second troublesome delta of eight arms fully
a mile in width, across a flat basin of pointed pebbles
and stones, until at last, to our great delight, we came to
smooth grass land, a soothing comfort to one's torn feet.</p>

<p class="figcenter">The Snow-Line at 16,000 Feet</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Here the Kuti River ran through a large basin, not
dissimilar to the one near which we had camped the night
before, having also the appearance of lake formation with
high perpendicular rocks on the left, which gave one the
impression of a vast wall&mdash;a rugged and forbidding
barrier. Proceeding N.W. the basin became wider and the
Kuti River turned to the N.W., while the Mangshan River,
descending from the East, joined the first stream in the centre
of the basin. In crossing the numerous branches of the
two rivers we again experienced, with almost accentuated
discomfort, the trials and weariness of the preceding day.
The water was colder than ever, our feet were by this time
in a dreadful condition, cut and bleeding, because it was
constantly necessary to walk bare-footed. Aching and
benumbed we stumbled on, in and out of water, always, it
seemed, encountering sharp small stones. For us there
could be no turning back however; the pain had to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_136" id="Pg_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
borne before the march was finished, and we won our
camping-ground at last under the lee of the high chain of
mountains to the North of us, and on the northern bank of
the Mangshan River. Directly in front stood the final
obstacle, the stupendous backbone of the Himahlyas; once
past this I should be on that high Tibetan plateau so accurately
and picturesquely called &quot;the roof of the world.&quot;</p>

<h5>The scouts return&mdash;A small exploring party&mdash;The Mangshan
glacier.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> Kuti I had despatched a sturdy Shoka, named Nattoo,
to ascertain whether it was possible to cross the chain over
the high Mangshan Pass, as in this case I should be enabled
to get many marches into Tibet by the jungle without fear
of being detected. I should thus get behind the force of
soldiers which I was informed the Jong Pen of Taklakot
had concentrated at the Lippu Pass to prevent my entering
the country, and before they could have time to discover
my whereabouts I should be too far ahead for them to find
me. Nattoo arrived in camp almost simultaneously with
ourselves and had a long tale of woe to relate. He had
been half way up the mountain. The snow was deep and
there were huge and treacherous cracks in the ice. As he
was on his way up, an avalanche had fallen, and it was
merely by the skin of his teeth that he had escaped with his
life. This was to him an evil omen, and he had turned
back without reaching the summit of the pass. He
seemed scared and worn out, and declared that it was
impossible for us to proceed that way. Unfortunately
the thrilling account of the Kutial's misfortunes had a
depressing effect on my men. What with the intense cold,
the fatigue of carrying heavy loads at high elevations over
such rough country, and the fearful rivers which they
dreaded, and so many of which we had crossed, my carriers
became absolutely demoralised at the thought of new hardships
ahead, all the more when I assured them that I
did not believe Nattoo, and that I should go and see for
myself.</p>

<p>It was 4.30 in the afternoon, and therefore some time
before sunset. There would be moonlight. I had on that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_138" id="Pg_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>
day marched eight miles,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> and though the soles of my feet
were cut and sore I was not really tired. Our camp was
at an elevation of 16,150 feet, a pretty respectable altitude
considering that the highest mountain in Europe is only
15,781 feet. Dr. Wilson insisted on accompanying me
to the top, and Kachi Ram and a Rongba coolie volunteered
to come as well. Bijesing, the Johari, got on his feet
after some persuasion, and that completed our little exploration
party. Chanden Sing, who was really the only man
I could trust, was left in charge of the camp, with strict
orders to punish severely any one who might attempt to
turn back during my absence.</p>

<p>We set out almost immediately after reaching camp,
following up stream the course of the Mangshan River,
which is boxed in between high cliffs, those south of it
running in a direction of 100&deg; (b.m.), those to the north
converging to 130&deg;; the two ranges eventually meeting in
the glacier at the foot of Mangshan, about three miles
E.-E.S.E. of our camp. There was no track, and the
walking was extremely difficult and troublesome, over large
slippery stones, between which one's feet constantly slipped
and got jammed, straining and injuring one's ankles. Little
trusting my followers, who seemed on the verge of mutiny,
I did not care to leave behind in camp the heavy load of
silver rupees (R. 800) sewn in my coat, which, by the way,
I always carried on my person, as well as my rifle, two
compasses (prismatic and luminous), two aneroids, one half-chronometer,
and another watch and some thirty cartridges.
The combined weight of these articles was considerable,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
and I felt it especially during the first days of my march.
On this particular afternoon it was almost too much for my
strength. However, one gets accustomed to most things,
and after a while I felt comparatively little discomfort in
marching under it. I persisted in thus weighting myself
simply to be on the safe side, so as to be always prepared
in case my men revolted or abandoned me.</p>

<p>We proceeded up and down the series of hillocks and in
and out of the innumerable channels that the melting snow
and ice had, with the aid of centuries, cut deep into the
mass of rolling stones. At the point where the two ranges
met there stood before us the magnificent pale green
ice-terraces of the Mangshan glacier, surmounted by extensive</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_140" id="Pg_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
snow-fields winding their way to the summit of
the mountain range. Clouds enveloped the higher
peaks. The clear Alpine ice showed vertical streaks,
especially in the lower part of the glacier, where it was
granulated to a certain extent. The base, the sides and top
being covered with a thick coat of fresh snow, and my time
being very limited, I was unable to make careful investigations
to ascertain the recent movement and oscillations of
this glacier. Judging by the nature of the stony tracts we
had passed over, and also by the mounds, similar to those of
a terminal moraine, which increased as we approached the
glacier and its snow-covered fringe, I concluded that the
glacier must have retreated considerably. The rocks and
stones, as I have already mentioned, were shiny and slippery,
which I attributed to the friction of the ice, and where the
ice had extended over gravel, this was greatly disturbed, and
scarred by innumerable channels, due, no doubt, to the
mighty force of the moving ice besides the constant action
of melting snows during the summer. The slopes of the
mountains on the north showed no indication of having
been disturbed, but the range on the southern side had all
the appearance of having been cut and excavated by the ice.
Probably the large basins which I had crossed on my way
from Kuti, and even the last one, facing our camp, were
after all reservoirs formed by ancient moraines with alluvial
deposits.</p>

<h5>Snow and troublesome <i>d&eacute;bris</i>&mdash;The doctor's sufferings&mdash;Kachi
disabled&mdash;Further trials&mdash;A weird apparition&mdash;Delirium&mdash;All
safe&mdash;The descent.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Mangshan River rises from this glacier, but we
left the glacier (17,800 feet) to the right, and, turning
sharply northwards, began our ascent towards the pass. To
gaze upon the incline before us was alone sufficient to
deter one from attempting to climb it, had one a choice;
in addition to this, the snow we struggled over was so soft
and deep that we sank into it up to our waists. Occasionally
the snow alternated with patches of loose <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and
rotten rock, on which we were no better off; in fact, the
fatigue of progressing over them was simply overpowering.
Having climbed up half-a-dozen steps among the loose
cutting stones, we felt ourselves sliding back to almost our
original point of departure, followed by a small avalanche
of shifting material that only stopped when it got to the
foot of the mountain.</p>

<p>At 19,000 feet we were for a considerable distance on soft
snow, covering an ice-field with deep crevasses and cracks
in it. We had to feel our way with great caution, particularly
as there was only the light of the moon to depend upon.</p>

<p>Fortunately, as we rose higher, there were no more
crevasses, but I began to feel a curious exhaustion that I
had never experienced before. At sunset the thermometer
which Kachi carried for me had descended forty degrees
within a few minutes, and the sudden change in the temperature
seemed to affect us all more or less; but we went
on, with the exception of Bijesing, who was seized with
mountain sickness so violently that he was unable to proceed.
The doctor, too, a man of powerful build, was suffer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_142" id="Pg_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span>ing
considerably. His legs, he said, had become like
lead, and each seemed to weigh a ton. The effort of lifting,
or even moving, them required all his energy. Although he
was terribly blown and gasping for breath, yet he would
not give in, and he struggled on bravely until we reached
an altitude of 20,500 feet. Here he was seized with such
exhaustion and pain that he was unable to proceed. Kachi
Ram, the Rongba and I went ahead, but we also were
suffering, Kachi complaining of violent beating in his
temples and loud buzzing in his ears. He also gasped
and staggered dangerously, threatening to collapse at
any moment. At 21,000 feet he fell flat on the snow.
He was instantly asleep, breathing heavily and snoring
raspingly. His hands and feet were icy cold, and I
rubbed them. But what caused me more anxiety than
anything was the irregular beating and throbbing of his
heart. I wrapped him up in his blanket and my waterproof,
and, having seen to his general comfort, I shouted to the
doctor, telling him what had happened, and that I was
going to push on as much higher as I could stand, the
Rongba being now the only one of the party who was able
to keep up.</p>

<p>A thick mist came on and enveloped us, which considerably
added to our trials. Our efforts to get on after we
left Kachi at 21,000 feet were desperate, our lungs in convulsion
as if about to burst, our pulses hastened, our hearts
throbbing (mine being ordinarily very regular) as if they
would beat themselves out of our bodies. Exhausted
and seized by irresistible drowsiness, the Rongba and I
nevertheless at last reached the top. It was a satisfaction to
have got there, to have reached such an altitude, although I
had long realised the impossibility of getting my men over
by this way. It served me also to ascertain the amount of
snow on the other side of the range, which, when the fog
lifted somewhat, I found to be greater on the northern
slope than on the southern. Although almost fainting
with fatigue, I registered my observations. The altitude
was 22,000 feet, the hour 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and there was a strong,
cutting North-East wind. I had stupidly forgotten to
take my thermometer out of Kachi's pocket when I left
him, and was unable to register the temperature, although
I had done so only a few minutes before I left Kachi at 21,000
feet. The cold was intense. The stars were extraordinarily
brilliant and the moon shone bright for a while over the
panorama around me, and though it was a view of utter
desolation, it had nevertheless a curious indescribable fascina<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_143" id="Pg_143"></a>[<a href="./images/143.png">143</a>]</span>tion.
Below me, to the south, were mountainous masses
buried in snow, and to the South-West and North-East were
peaks even higher than the one on which I stood. To the
north stretched the immense, dreary Tibetan plateau with
undulations and intricate hill ranges, beyond which a high
mountain range with snow peaks could just be perceived
in the distance. I could see very little snow near by, except
on the northern slope of the range I was standing on, and
on the hill-tops which dotted the plateau.</p>

<p>I had barely taken it in, barely realised the wonder of
nature asleep when the mist again rose before me
and I saw a gigantic phantom rising out of it. It
stood in the centre of a luminous circle, a tall, dark
figure in the folds of an enormous veil of mist. The
effect was overwhelming, and it was only after some
moments that I realised that the spectre wore my features,
was a liquid presentation of my own proportions colossally
enlarged; that I stood in the centre of a lunar rainbow, and
that I was gazing on the reflection of myself in the mist.
As I moved my arms, my body, or my head, the ghostlike
figure moved, and I felt myself irresistibly changing my
postures&mdash;oddly and nervously at first&mdash;then, with an
awakening sense of the ridiculous in my actions&mdash;so as to
make my image change and do as I did. I felt like a child
placed for the first time in front of a mirror.</p>

<p>The illustration on <a href="#Pg_145">page 145</a> represents a solar spectre
with circular rainbow which I saw later on at a comparatively
low altitude; the lunar effect differed from this
in that the colours of the rainbow were but faintly distinguishable.</p>

<p>The Rongba had fallen exhausted, and I felt so faint
with the awful pressure on my lungs, that, despite all my
efforts to resist it, I collapsed on the snow. The coolie
and I, shivering pitifully, shared the same blanket for additional
warmth. Both of us were seized with irresistible
drowsiness, as if we had taken a strong narcotic. I
fought hard against it, for I well knew that if my eyelids
once closed they would almost certainly remain so for ever.
I called to the Rongba. He was fast asleep. I summoned
up my last atom of vitality to keep my eyes open. The
wind blew hard and biting, with a hissing noise. How
that hiss still sounds in my ears! It seemed like the
whisper of death. The Rongba, crouched with teeth
chattering, was moaning, and his sudden shudders bespoke
great pain. It seemed only common charity to let him have
the blanket, which was in any case too small for both, so I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_144" id="Pg_144"></a>[<a href="./images/144.png">144</a>]</span>
wrapped it tightly round his head and body. He was
doubled up with his chin on his knees. This small exertion
was quite sufficient to make me lose the tug-of-war in which
I was pulling against nature. Just like the subject who,
under hypnotic influence, feels his own will and power
suddenly going from him, so I felt the entire hopelessness
of further struggle against the supernatural forces I was
contending with. Falling backwards on the snow, I made
a last desperate effort to gaze at the glittering stars ... my
sight became dim and obscured....</p>

<p>For how long this semi-consciousness lasted, I do not
know. &quot;God! how ghastly! Doctor! Kachi!&quot; I tried
to articulate. My voice seemed choked in my throat. Was
what I saw before me real? The two men, as if frozen to
death by the side of each other, seemed lying on that vast
white sheet of snow, motionless as statues of ice. In my
dream I attempted to raise them. They were quite rigid. I
knelt beside them, calling them and frantically striving to
bring them back to consciousness and life. Bewildered, I
turned round to look for Bijesing, and, as I did so, all
sense of vitality seemed to freeze within me. I saw myself
enclosed in a quickly contracting tomb of transparent
ice. It was easy to realise that I too would shortly be
nothing but a solid block of ice, like my companions. My
legs, my arms were already congealed. Horror-stricken
as I was at the approach of such a hopeless, ghastly death,
my sensations were accompanied by a languor and
lassitude indescribable but far from unpleasant. To some
extent thought or wonderment was still alive. Should
I dwindle painlessly away, preferring rest and peace to
effort, or should I make a last struggle to save myself?
The ice seemed to close in more and more every moment.
I was choking.</p>

<p>I tried to scream! to force myself through the suffocating
weight on me! I gave a violent plunge, and then everything
had vanished. The frozen Kachi, the doctor, the
transparent tomb! Nothingness!</p>

<p>At last I was able to open my eyes, which ached as if
needles had been stuck into them. It was snowing hard.
I had temporarily lost the use of my legs and fingers.
They were frozen. So violent was the shock of realising
how very near death I had really been, that in waking up
from the ghastly nightmare I became acutely alive to the full
importance of instantly making my way down to a lower level.
I was already covered with a layer of snow, and I suppose
it was the frigid pressure on my forehead that caused the</p>

dream. It is, however, probable that, had it not been for
the hideous vision that shook my nerves free of paralysing
torpor, I should never have awakened from that spell-bound
silence.</p>

<p>I sat up with difficulty, and by beating and rubbing
them, slowly regained the use of my lower limbs. I roused
the Rongba, rubbed him, and shook him till he was able to
move. We began our descent.</p>

<p>No doubt the satisfaction of going up high mountains is
very great; but can it be compared to that of coming
down?</p>

<p>Descending was dangerous but not wearisome. The
incline being extremely steep, we took gigantic strides
on the snow, and when we came to patches of <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, we
slid ten or fifteen feet each step amidst a deafening roar
from the huge mass of loose stones set in motion by our
descent.</p>

<p class="figcenter">&quot;I Roused the Rongba&quot;</p>
<hr class="short" />
<p>&quot;Hark!&quot; I said to the Rongba, &quot;what is that?&quot;</p>

<p>We waited till all was silence, and with hands up to our
ears listened attentively. It was still snowing.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ao, ao, ao! Jaldi ao! Tumka hatte?</i> Come, come,
come quickly! Where are you?&quot; cried a faint distressed
voice from far down below.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_147" id="Pg_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
We quickened our pace; having hardly any control over
our legs, our descent was precipitous. The snow-fall ceased
and we became enveloped in a thick mist which pierced into
our very bones.</p>

<p>Guided by the anxious cries of the doctor, whose voice
we recognised, we continued our breakneck journey downward.
The cries got more and more distinct, and at last,
to my great joy, we came face to face with Wilson, who,
thank Heaven, was alive but almost helpless, as he said his
legs were still like lead, and it was all he could do to move
them.</p>

<p>Owing to his anxiety about us, he had been shouting
for a long time, and getting no answer, he became
very uneasy, all the more so as he found he could in
no way come to our help. He had quite given us up for
lost.</p>

<p>We looked for and found Kachi. He had slept like a top,
curled up in his warm blanket and my overcoat, and was
now quite refreshed, so all united again, we continued our
race downwards, exchanging our experiences and sensations.
We had no very serious mishaps, and life and strength
gradually came back to us again when we descended to lower
elevations. The ascent from the glacier at the bottom of
the mountain to the summit occupied four and a half
hours; the precipitous descent, without counting stoppages,
only the ninth part of that time, the distance covered being
about one mile and three quarters.</p>

<p>Over the same trying stony valley we reached camp during
the early hours of the morning. The distance from camp to
the altitude reached and back was over ten miles; therefore,
during the twenty-four hours I had altogether gone eighteen
miles (quite a record at such great altitudes). I may here
also remark that, since breakfast at six o'clock the previous
morning, I had taken no food of any kind, thus making an
interval of twenty-three hours between one meal and the
next. The anxiety of my men in camp was intense. They
had lost all hope of seeing us again, and they were quite
reassured when I told them that we would proceed later in
the morning by the Lumpiya Pass, which was believed to be
far easier.</p>

<p>In no time they had lighted a fire of dung, and after
having had (at five o'clock in the morning) a handsome feed
of rice, <i>chapatis</i>, extract of meat, and strengthening emergency
food, we felt we were entitled to a well-deserved
rest.</p>

<h5>The sources of the Kuti River&mdash;The Lumpiya glacier&mdash;The
summit of the range&mdash;Bird's-eye view of Tibet&mdash;Rubso frozen
almost to death&mdash;The Lumpiya Pass&mdash;Two coolies in distress.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">At 9 a.m.</span> we were ready again to start. The thermometer
registered 40&deg; inside the tent, and the minimum temperature
outside during the night had been 14&deg;. We followed the Kuti
River at the foot of the mountain range, travelling in a
direction of 298&deg; (b.m). On rounding a prominent headland,
where the Kuti River flows through a narrow passage,
we saw facing us on a mound, fourteen stone pillars and
pyramids with white stones on them and the customary
flying prayers of cloth. It is from this point that the ascent
to the Lumpiya Pass begins.</p>

<p>There are two sources of the Kuti Yangti, joining in a
large basin; one comes from two extensive glaciers to the
S.W., the other from a glacier directly under the Lumpiya
Pass. The river at the junction of the two sources is not
more than six yards across. Our route gradually ascended,
going N.W. first, then swinging away to N.E. until we attained
an elevation of 17,350 feet on a flat basin covered with deep
snow. So far we had proceeded with no very great trouble
or fatigue, but matters suddenly altered for the worse.
Each coolie in the long silent row at the head of which I
marched, sank in the snow up to his knees, often up to his
waist. They formed, undoubtedly, a picturesque sight in
this lonely region, the only bit of life in the picture, the
white frozen sheet of snow throwing into strong contrast
their faces wrapped tightly round with white turbans.
Some wore fur caps with ear flaps; all had long sheepskin
coats and high boots of skins; many used snow
spectacles; and as this procession, silent and grave,
with loads on their backs, struggled higher and higher</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_150" id="Pg_150"></a>[<a href="./images/150.png">150</a>]</span>
with piteous panting, you speculated apprehensively
as to how many of them would ever return. Moving
cautiously to avoid the many treacherous cracks, I made
my way ahead with considerable trouble to a spot six
hundred feet higher, where I halted for a while on a rocky
island fairly clear of snow. As coolie after coolie arrived,
breathing convulsively, he dropped his load and sat quietly
by the side of it. There was not a grumble, not a word of
reproach for the hard work they were made to endure.
Sleet was falling, and the wet and cold increased the discomfort.
There was now a very steep pull before us. To the
left, we had a glacier beginning in a precipitous fall of ice,
about one hundred feet in height. Like the Mangshan
glacier, it was in horizontal ribbon-like strata of beautifully
clear ice, showing no dirt bands. Perpendicular stripes
of a darker greenish colour could be observed arising
from the unequal degrees of compactness of the ice; the
strata showed almost horizontal, with no curvatures nor
depressions in any part of them. The top, the base and the
sides of the glacier were in this case also buried in deep snow.</p>

<p>The doctor and I went ahead. In our anxiety to reach
the summit, unable to discern the track, now covered by
several feet of snow, we mistook our bearings, and with
great fatigue climbed up an extremely steep incline. Here
we were on a patch of the troublesome loose <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, on
which we struggled for over half an hour until we reached
the top of the range, 18,750 feet, considerably higher than
the pass itself. Four men had come with us, the others, to
whom we signalled, bearing more to the west by another
dangerous track skirting the glacier.</p>

<p>The wind from the N.E. was piercing and the cold
terrible. Under the lee of a large rock we found temporary
shelter, and through my telescope scanned the Tibetan plateau
spread out before us. From this high eyrie we obtained a
superb bird's-eye view. Huge masses of snow covered the
Tibetan side of the Himahlyas, as well as the lower range of
mountains immediately in front of us, running almost parallel
to our range. Two thousand feet below, between these two
ranges, flowed, in a wide barren valley, a river which is
afterwards called the Darma Yankti or Lumpiya Yankti.
In the distance, a flat plateau, rising some eight hundred
feet above the river, and resembling a gigantic embankment
of a railway line, could be seen extending for many miles;
and far away to the north, a chain of high blue mountains
capped with snow, undoubtedly the Kangri chain with the
Kelas peaks.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_152" id="Pg_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
A painful incident had unfortunately happened to one of
my followers: poor Rubso, a Christian convert, had fallen
exhausted from cold and fatigue. He had been seized with
cramp, and was lying in a semi-conscious state, his teeth
chattering and his features distorted and livid; his eyes
were sunken and lifeless, and he showed signs of complete
collapse. We hastily carried him under the shelter of a
rock and rubbed him vigorously, in the hope of restoring
his circulation. After more than half an hour of the greatest
anxiety and exertion, to our intense relief he partially recovered,
and was able to proceed slowly with our help.</p>

<p>Having climbed the wrong path, we now had to descend
to the pass, six hundred feet lower. We made our way
along dangerous rocks and <i>d&eacute;bris</i>. I was just clinging with
my half-frozen fingers to a prominent rock, striving to get
on the other side, when screams of distress from below
struck my ears. Notwithstanding the unsafe position I was
in, I could not help turning my head to see what had
happened. On the steep incline of snow two coolies with
their respective loads were sliding, at incredible speed.
They eventually reached the basin, where the angle of the
descent being suddenly altered, it caused them to revolve
several times on their own axes, the different bags, &amp;c.,
forming their loads, flying about and being scattered in
every direction. I gave a sigh of relief when I saw the
men getting up. One coolie picked up one after the
other the goods that had been entrusted to him, tied them
together, got them on his back, and began the difficult
ascent a second time. The other was crying and moaning,
so that we could plainly hear him from our elevation. He
seemed giddy. After a moment or two he staggered, fell
back and lay as if dead. Hastening over the slippery
rocks, and then down precipitously on the loose <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, I
gained the pass, 18,150 feet. Two reluctant men were
immediately despatched to the relief of the coolie in distress.
They first carried his load up, then him. After some time
he, too, got over the severe shock and fright, and though
he was rather shattered and aching all over, I succeeded in
persuading the man that nothing was the matter with him.</p>

<p>We then hurried down the steep declivity on the Tibetan
side, to get away quickly from the bitterly cold, windy
pass. Describing a wide arc of a circle, and then making
straight down across several long snow-beds, we at last
reached the river level and pitched our tents on snow at an
altitude of 16,900 feet. There was no wood, no yak or pony
dung, no lichens, no moss, and therefore nothing with which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_153" id="Pg_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>
we could make a fire. It seemed hard upon my men that,
after such a toilsome day, they should be compelled to go to
sleep without having had a good meal. They believe&mdash;and
they are right&mdash;that eating cold food at such high elevations,
with such low temperature, leads to certain death. They
preferred, therefore, to remain without food altogether.
Night came, and with it the wind blowing in gusts, and
piling the grit and snow around our tents. During the nocturnal
hours, with the hurricane raging, we had to turn out
of our flapping canvases several times to make the loose pegs
firmer. Fastening all the frozen ropes was very cold work.
At 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the thermometer was down to 12&deg;. At 9 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> in
the sun, it went up to 26&deg;, and inside the tent at the same
hour we had a temperature as high as 32&deg;&mdash;freezing-point.</p>

<h5>Mysterious footprints&mdash;Brigand or spy?&mdash;Passes and tracks&mdash;Intense
cold&mdash;No fuel&mdash;A high flat plateau&mdash;Fuel at last!&mdash;Two
spies in disguise&mdash;What they took us for.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a hurricane of grit and drenching rain we packed up our
traps as best we could and again started on our way. I
was slightly in advance when, to my surprise, I noticed,
some two hundred yards only from camp, a double
line of recent footmarks on the snow. Those coming
towards us were somewhat indistinct and nearly covered
with grit, those going in the opposite direction seemed
quite recent. After carefully examining these footprints, I
felt pretty certain that they had been made by a Tibetan.
Where the footprints stopped, marks in the snow showed
that the man had at different points laid himself flat on the
ground. No doubt we had been spied upon and watched.
My own men had shown many signs of terror ever since
we had crossed to this side of the Himahlyas, and were
now all anxiously stooping low over these prints and
speculating on their origin. Their excitement and fear
were strange to watch. Some surmised that the man must
be a <i>Daku</i>, a brigand, and that in the evening we should be
attacked by the whole band; others maintained that the
spy could only be a Sepoy sent by the Gyanema officers
to watch our movements. In any case, this incident was
held to be an evil omen, and during our march in a
N.W. direction along the bank of the river we continually
saw the trail. The wildest speculations and imaginations
were rife. To the left of us we passed the valleys leading
south to the Neway Pass; then a second to the Kats,
230&deg; (b.m.). The bearings were taken from the mouth of the
river descending from it, a tributary of the Darma Yangti.</p>

Six miles from our last camp, at bearings 340&deg;, was the
Luway Pass.</p>

<p>We were travelling on flat or slightly undulating barren
ground. We waded across another cold river with water
up to our waists, and my men became so exhausted that
one mile farther we had to halt at 16,650 feet.</p>

<p>The cold was intense, and again we had no fuel of any
kind. A furious wind was blowing, with snow falling
heavily in the evening. My carriers, half starved, ate a
little <i>satoo</i>, a kind of oatmeal, but Chanden Sing, a
Rajiput, could not, without breaking his caste, eat his
food without undressing. It was two days since he
had had his last meal, but rather than infringe the rules
of his religion, or take off his clothes in such frigid
regions, he preferred to curl up in his blanket and go to
sleep fasting.</p>

<p>The doctor left the warmth and comfort of blankets to go
and talk with the men, and get their views about weather
prospects and the chances of our route. I preferred the
comfort of such warmth as I could get in our tent, where
the temperature was 28&deg; Fahr., or four degrees below
freezing. The snow was lying a foot deep, and it was still
falling heavily. The carriers were all attempting to sleep,
huddled as close as possible to each other for warmth; they
refused to move, saying they would rather die, and we
found it convenient to believe them, and get what warmth
and sleep we could under blankets in the tent.</p>

<p>Two or three hours later the weather cleared. The
coolies, half starved, came to complain that they were again
unable to find fuel to cook their food, and that they would
leave me. The position of affairs was critical. I immediately
took my telescope and clambered to the top of
a small hillock. It was curious to note what unbounded
faith the coolies had in this glass. It was evident that they
believed in a childlike fashion that I could see through
mountains with it. I came down with the reassuring news
that one day's march further would bring us to a fine supply
of fuel.</p>

<p>They cheerfully hastened to pack up the loads, and set
forth with unusual energy in the direction I had pointed
out. We followed a parallel line to the high flat plateau on
the other side of the stream, the slopes of which, in relation
to the plain we were standing on, were at an obtuse angle
of about 115&deg;. The snow-covered plateau extended from
S.W. to N.E. Beyond it to the N. could be seen some
high snowy peaks, in all probability the lofty summits S.E.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_157" id="Pg_157"></a>[<a href="./images/157.png">157</a>]</span>
of Gartok. At the point where the Luway joins the other
three rivers there is a direct way to the summit of the
tableland, along which it continues across the Himahlyas by
the Luway Pass. To our right we were flanked by high
rugged mountains, with an occasional precipitous torrent.
Six hours' brisk marching took us to a sheltered nook,
where a few lichens and shrubs were growing. If we had
suddenly descended into the Black Forest of Germany, or
the Yosemite Valley, with their gigantic century old trees,
our delight could not have been greater. As it was, the
highest of these shrubs stood no higher than six or seven
inches from the ground, while the diameter of the largest
piece of wood we collected was smaller than that of an
ordinary pencil. With feverish activity all hands went to
work to root up these plants for fuel.</p>

<p>When night came, the same number of hands were busy
cooking and transferring with alarming celerity such
steaming food as was available from the different fires to
the mouths of the famished coolies. Happiness reigned in
camp, and all recent hardships were forgotten.</p>

<p>A fresh surprise was awaiting us when we rose. Two
Tibetans disguised as beggars had come to our camp.
They professed to be suffering from cold and starvation.
I gave orders that they should be properly fed and kindly
treated. On being cross-examined they confessed that they
were spies sent by the officer at Gyanema to ascertain
whether a sahib had crossed the frontier, and whether we
had seen anything of him.</p>

<p>We had so many things to attend to in the morning, and
it was so cold, that washing had really become a nuisance,
and I for my part gave it up, at least <i>pro tem.</i> We were
sunburnt, and we wore turbans and snow-glasses, so the
Tibetans departed under the impression that our party
consisted of a Hindoo doctor, his brother, and a caravan of
servants (none of whom had seen a sahib coming), and
that we were now on a pilgrimage to the sacred Mansarowar
Lake and Kelas Mount.</p>

<p>Before the men we treated this as a great joke, but, all
the same, Wilson and I anxiously consulted as to our
immediate plans. Should we make a rapid march during
the night over the mountain range to our right, and strike
east by the jungle, or should we face the Gyanema leader
and his soldiers?</p>

<p>We decided to meet them rather than go out of our way,
and I gave orders to raise camp immediately.</p>

<h5>Lama Chokden&mdash;A Tibetan guard&mdash;The sacred Kelas&mdash;Reverence
of my men for the Sacred Mountain&mdash;Trying hard
to keep friends with the gods&mdash;<i>Obos</i>&mdash;Water flowing to us.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> altered our course from N. to N.E., rising to 16,600
feet, and leaving the high tableland to the west. We arrived
at Lama Chokden (or Chorten), a pass protected by a
Tibetan guard, who quickly turned out, matchlocks in
hand, as we approached. They seemed a miserable lot,
and not only offered no resistance, but actually begged
for money and food. They complained of ill-treatment
by their superiors, stating that they received no pay, and
even food was only occasionally sent to them at this
outpost. Their tunics were in rags; each man carried a
sword stuck in front through the girdle. Here, too, we had
more inquiries about the young sahib, as messengers on
horseback had been sent post-haste from Taklakot to warn
the Gyanema officer not to let him penetrate into Hundes<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
by the Lumpiya Pass, should he attempt it. Their
description of my supposed appearance was very amusing,
and when they said that if the sahib came they would have
to cut his head off, I felt so touched by their good-natured
confidence that I wanted to distribute a few rupees among
them.</p>

<p>&quot;Do not give them anything, sir,&quot; said Kachi and the
doctor. &quot;These fellows are hand and glove with the bands
of dacoits; the latter will soon be told that we have money,
and we shall run great risk of being attacked at night.&quot;</p>

<p>I insisted on giving them a present.</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir,&quot; cried Kachi, distressed; &quot;do not do it, or it
will bring us no end of trouble and misfortune. If you
give them four annas, that will be ample.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_160" id="Pg_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span></p>
<p>Accordingly the officer in command had this large sum
deposited in the outstretched palm of his hand, and to show
his satisfaction, he pulled out his tongue to its full length,
waving both his hands at me for some minutes, and bowing
clumsily at the same time. His fur cap had been previously
removed and thrown on the ground. This was indeed a
grand salaam, a ceremonious acknowledgment of a gift of
something less than fourpence!</p>

<p>While the doctor remained in conversation with him, I
happened to witness a very beautiful sight. To the north the
clouds had dispersed, and the snow-capped sacred Kelas
Mount stood majestic before us. In appearance not unlike
the graceful roof of a temple, Kelas towers over the long
white-capped range, contrasting in beautiful blending of tints
with the warm sienna colour of the lower elevations. Kelas is
some two thousand feet higher than the other peaks of the
Gangir chain, with strongly defined ledges and terraces
marking its stratifications, and covered with horizontal layers
of snow standing out in brilliant colour against the dark ice-worn
rock. The Tibetans, the Nepalese, the Shokas, the
Humlis, Jumlis and Hindoos, all have a strong veneration
for this mountain, which is believed by them to be the
abode of all the good gods, especially of the god Siva.
In fact, the ledge round its base is said by the Hindoos
to be the mark of the ropes used by the devil (Rakas) to pull
down the throne of Siva.</p>

<p>My men, with heads uncovered, their faces turned towards
the sacred peak, were muttering prayers. With joined
hands, which they slowly raised as high as the forehead,
they prayed fervently, and then went down on their knees,
with heads bent low to the ground. My brigand follower,
who was standing close by me, hurriedly whispered that I
should join in this act of prayer.</p>

<p>&quot;You must keep friends with the gods,&quot; said the bandit;
&quot;misfortune will attend you if you do not salaam to Kelas;
that is the home of a good god!&quot; and he pointed to the
peak with the most devout air of conviction.</p>

<p>To please him I saluted the mountain with the utmost
deference, and, taking my cue from the others, placed a
white stone on one of the hundreds of <i>Chokdens</i> or <i>Obos</i>
(stone pillars) erected by devotees at this spot. These <i>Obos</i>,
or rough pyramids of stones, are found on the tracks
traversing all high passes, near lakes, in fact, everywhere,
but rarely in such quantities as at Lama Chokden. The
hill in front, and at the back of the guard-house, was literally
covered with these structures. Each passer-by deposits a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_161" id="Pg_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>
stone on one of them&mdash;a white stone if possible&mdash;and this is
supposed to bring him good fortune, or if he has a wish he
desires accomplished, such a contribution will enhance the
chances of its fulfilment.</p>

<p>The guard-house itself was of rough stone, mean and
desolate, and in any country but Tibet would not be considered
fit accommodation for pigs.</p>

<p>After going a mile or so farther, as the sun was fast
disappearing, we searched for a suitable spot to pitch
our tents. There was no sign of any water, only the
stony bed of a dried rivulet. We were discussing the
situation, when a faint sound as of rushing water struck
our ears. It grew louder and louder, and then we saw
coming towards us a stream of limpid molten snow,
gradually advancing over the bed of stones. Evidently the
snow of the mountains had taken all day to melt, and the
water was only now reaching this spot. My dacoit was in
a great state of excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;Water flowing to you, sahib!&quot; he exclaimed, with his
arms outstretched. &quot;You will have great luck! Look!
Look! You want water for your camp, and a stream comes
to you! Heaven blesses you. You must dip your fingers
into the water as soon as it comes up to you, and throw
some drops over your shoulders. Then will fortune attend
you on your journey.&quot;</p>

<p>I readily fell in with this Tibetan superstition, and we all
dipped our fingers, and sprinkled the water behind our
backs. Wilson, however, who took the matter quite seriously,
said it was all nonsense, and would not give in to such
&quot;childish fancy.&quot;</p>

<p>Good fortune would have meant much to me, but in the
days to come this simple rite proved to have been futile!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> front of our camp was a great stretch of flat alluvial land,
which had been, to all appearance, at some remote time the
bed of a large lake about ten miles long and fourteen wide.
With my telescope I could see plainly to 40&deg; (b.m.), at the
foot of a small hill, the camping-ground of Karko. There
were many tents, and my men seemed much reassured when
by their shape and colour we made them out to be those of
the Joharis from Milam, who come over at this place to
trade with the Hunyas<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>. To E.N.E. we had a valley

to the North, a stretch of water, the Gyanema Lake,
showed brilliantly, and beyond it some comparatively low
hill ranges. In the distance, more snowy peaks were visible.</p>

<p>On leaving camp we traversed the plain for six miles
in a N.E. direction, and then, on a course of 80&deg; (b.m.),
turned into a smaller valley well enclosed by hills, following
it for a distance of three or four miles. This formed, as
it were, an arm of the other large valley.</p>

<p>During our march we saw many large herds of <i>Kiang</i>
(wild horse). These animals came quite close to us. They
resembled zebras in shape and movement of body, but
in colour they were mostly light brown. The natives
regarded their near proximity as extremely dangerous;
for their apparent tameness is often deceptive, enabling
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_163" id="Pg_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
them to draw quite close to the unwary traveller, and then
with a sudden dash seize him by the stomach, inflicting
a horrible wound with their powerful jaws. Their graceful
and coquettish ways were most taking; we occasionally
threw stones at them to keep them at a safe distance, but
after cantering prettily away, they would follow us again
and come within a few yards. I succeeded in taking some
very good negatives, which unfortunately were afterwards
destroyed by the Tibetan authorities. I still have, however,
some of the sketches I made of them. We climbed over
another hill range, and descended on the other side into
a grassy stretch of flat land, in the Northern portion of which
was a sheet of water. On a hill South of the lake stood the
Gyanema Khar or fort, a primitive tower-like structure of
stones, with a tent pitched over it to answer the purpose of
roof, supporting a flagstaff, on which flew two dirty white
rags. They were not the colours of Hundes, but only wind
prayers. Lower down, at the foot of the hill, were two
or three large black tents and a small shed of stones.
Hundreds of black, white, and brown yaks were grazing on
the green patches of grass.</p>

<p>The appearance of our party evidently created some apprehension,
for we had hardly shown ourselves on the summit of
the col when from the fort a gong began to sound loudly,
filling the air with its unmelodious metallic notes. A shot
was fired. Soldiers with their matchlocks were seen running
here and there. They pulled down one of the black tents
and hastily conveyed it inside the fort, the greater part
of the garrison also seeking shelter within the walls
with the <i>empressement</i> almost of a stampede. When, after
some little time, they convinced themselves that we had
no evil intentions, some of the Tibetan officers, followed by
their men, came trembling to meet us. The doctor, unarmed,
went ahead to talk with them, whereas my bearer
and I remained with the coolies for the double purpose
of protecting our baggage in case of a treacherous attack,
and of preventing my panic-stricken carriers from abandoning
their loads and escaping. But matters looked peaceful
enough. Rugs were spread on the grass, and eventually we
all sat down. An hour's trying parley with the Tibetan officers,
during which time the same things were repeated over and
over again, led to nothing. They said they could on no
account allow any one from India, whether native or sahib,
to proceed, and we must go back. We on our side stated
that we were doing no harm. We were pilgrims to the
sacred Lake of Mansarowar, only a few miles farther. We
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_164" id="Pg_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span>
had gone to much expense and trouble. How could we
now turn back when so near our goal? We would not
go back, and trusted they would allow us to proceed.</p>

<p>We treated them courteously and kindly, and probably
mistaking this for fear they promptly took advantage of it,
especially the Magbun<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> or chief officer in charge of the
Gyanema fort. His marked humility, of which at first he
had made so much display, suddenly turned into arrogance.
&quot;You will have to cut off my head,&quot; said he with a vicious
countenance, &quot;or rather I will cut off yours before I let you
go another step.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Cut off my head?&quot; cried I, jumping on my feet and
shoving a cartridge into my rifle.</p>

<p>&quot;Cut off my head?&quot; repeated my bearer, pointing with his
Martini-Henry at the official.</p>

<p>&quot;Cut off our heads?&quot; queried angrily the Brahmin and the
two Christian servants of Dr. Wilson, handling a Winchester
and a couple of Gourkha <i>kukris</i> (large knives).</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, no, no! Salaam, salaam, salaam!&quot; poured forth
the Magbun with the celerity of speech only possessed by
a panic-stricken man. &quot;Salaam, salaam,&quot; repeated he again,
bowing down to the ground, tongue out, and depositing his
hat at our feet in a disgustingly servile manner. &quot;Let us
talk like friends!&quot;</p>

<p>The Magbun's men, no braver than their master, shifted
their positions in a nonchalant manner so as to be
screened by their superiors in case of our firing, and
on second thoughts, judging even such a precaution to
ensure them but scanty safety, they one after the other got
up, walked steadily away for half-a-dozen steps, to show it
was not fear that made them leave, and then took to their
heels.</p>

<p>The Magbun and the other officers who remained became
more and more meek. We spoke and argued in a friendly
manner for two long hours, but with no appreciable
results. The Magbun could not decide of his own accord.
He would consult with his officers, and he could give us an
answer no sooner than the next morning. In the meantime
he would provide for our general comfort and ensure our
safety, if we would encamp near his tent. This, of course,
I well knew to be an expedient to gain time, so as to send
for soldiers to Barca, north of the Rakstal Lake, as well
as to all the neighbouring camps. I frankly told him
my suspicions, but added that I wished to deal fairly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_165" id="Pg_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
with the Tibetan authorities before resorting to force. I
reminded the Magbun again, and made him plainly understand,
that we were merely peaceful travellers, and had not
come to fight; that I was paying tenfold for anything I
purchased from him or his men, and was glad to do so; but
at the same time, let the hand beware that dared touch or
twist a single hair of any one belonging to my party!
The Magbun declared that he understood perfectly. He
swore friendship, and as friends he begged us to stop over
the night near his camp. By the Sun and Kunju Sum
(Trinity) he gave a solemn oath that we should in no way
be harmed. He took humble leave of us and retired.</p>

<p>The doctor and I had been sitting in front, next were
Chanden Sing, the Brahmin, and the two Christians. The
carriers were behind. When the Magbun had gone I
turned round to look at them. Behold, what a sight!
They one and all were crying miserably, each man hiding
his face in his hands. Kachi had tears streaming down
his cheeks, Dola was sobbing, while the Daku and the
other Tibetan in my employ, who had for the occasion
assumed a disguise, were concealing themselves behind
their loads. Serious though the situation was, I could not
help laughing at the demoralisation of my men. We
pitched our tents, and I had been sitting a while inside
one, registering my observations and writing up my
diary, when Kachi crept in, apparently in great distress.
He seemed so upset that he could hardly speak.</p>

<p>&quot;Master!&quot; he whispered. &quot;Master! The Tibetans have
sent a man to your coolies threatening them that they must
betray you or die. They must abandon you during the
night, and if you attempt to retain them, they must kill
you.&quot;</p>

<p>At the same time that this agent had been sent to
conspire with my coolies, other envoys of the Magbun
brought huge masses of dry dung to make our fires,
conveying to me his renewed declarations of friendship.
Notwithstanding this, soldiers were despatched
in every direction to call for help. I saw them start:
one went towards Kardam and Taklakot; a second
proceeded in the direction of Barca, and a third galloped
to the West.</p>

<p>My carriers were evidently preparing a <i>coup-de-main</i> as
I watched them through an opening in the tent. They
were busily engaged separating their blankets and clothes
from my loads, dividing the provisions among themselves,
and throwing aside my goods. I went out to them, patiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_166" id="Pg_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
made them repack the things, and cautioned them that I
would shoot any one who attempted to revolt or desert.</p>

<p>While the doctor and I sat down to a hearty meal, which
rumours in camp said would be our last, Chanden Sing was
entrusted with the preparations for war on our side. He
cleaned the rifles with much care, and got the ammunition
ready, for he was longing to fight. The Brahmin, on whose
faithfulness we could also rely, remained cool and collected
through the whole affair. He was a philosopher, and never
worried over anything. He took no active part in preparing
for our defence, for he feared not death. God alone could
kill him, he argued, and all the matchlocks in the country
together could not send a bullet through him unless God
wished it. And if it were the God's decree that he should die,
what could be the use of rebelling against it? The two
converts, like good Christians, were more practical, and lost
no time in grinding the huge blades of their <i>kukris</i> to the
sharpness of razors.</p>

<p>When darkness came a guard was placed, at a little distance
off, all round our camp. It seemed likely that a rush
on our tent with the help of my treacherous carriers was
contemplated, should an opportunity occur. One of us
kept watch outside all through the night, and those inside
lay down in their clothes, with loaded rifles by them. I
can't say that either Dr. Wilson or I felt particularly uneasy,
for the Tibetan soldiers with their clumsy matchlocks, long
spears, and jewelled swords and daggers, inspired us more
with admiration for their picturesque appearance than with fear.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h5>Arrival of a high official&mdash;The Barca Tarjum&mdash;A tedious
palaver&mdash;The Tarjum's anxiety&mdash;Permission to proceed&mdash;A
traitor&mdash;Entreated to retrace our steps&mdash;Thirty armed horsemen&mdash;A
pretty speech.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Quite</span> early the next morning we were roused by the
distant sound of tinkling horse-bells. On looking out of
the tent, I saw a long row of pack-ponies heavily laden,
escorted by a number of mounted soldiers with matchlocks
and spears. It was evident that some high official was coming.
This advance detachment consisted of his subalterns
and his baggage. They took a long sweep far away from our
tent and dismounted by the Gyanema fort. Other soldiers
and messengers were constantly arriving in groups from
all directions. The leader of one party, with a considerable
escort of soldiers, was received with profuse salaams
and I concluded that he must be an important personage.</p>

<p>After some time a message was sent to us that this new
comer, the Barca Tarjum, practically a potentate equal in
rank to a king under a protectorate, wished to have the
honour of seeing us. We replied that we were having our
breakfast and that we would send for him when we wished
to speak to him. Our experience had taught us that it
was advisable to treat Tibetan officials as inferiors, as they
were then more subdued, and easier to deal with. At eleven
we despatched a messenger to the fort to say we should be
pleased to receive the Tarjum. He came immediately with
a large following, a picturesque figure dressed in a long
coat of green silk of Chinese shape, with large sleeves
turned up, showing his arms up to the elbow; he had
a cap similar to those worn by Chinese officials, and was
shod with heavy long black boots, with large nails under the
soles. His long, pale, angular face was remarkable in many
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_168" id="Pg_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
ways; it was interestingly stolid, and though somewhat
effeminate, had rather fine features; unmistakable signs
of depravity indicated his low class of mind and morals.
Long hair fell in loose curls down to his shoulders, and
hanging from his left ear was an earring of large dimensions,
with malachite ornaments and a pendant. In his nervous
fingers he held a small roll of Tibetan material, which he
used with both hands as a handkerchief to blow his nose
inconsequently every time that he was at a loss to answer
a question. The Tarjum and his men were profuse in
their bows, and there was, as usual, a great display of
tongues. These were, I noticed, of an unhealthy whitish
colour, caused throughout Tibet by excessive tea-drinking,
a practice which ruins the digestion, and furs their tongues.
We had rugs placed outside our principal tent, and the
doctor and I sat on one, asking the Tarjum to sit on the
one facing us. His followers squatted around him. It
is a well-known fact that in Tibet, if you are a &quot;somebody,&quot;
or if you wish people to recognise your importance,
you must have an umbrella spread over your head. Fortunately,
the ever-provident doctor had two in his possession;
which two of our men held over our respective heads. The
Tarjum himself was shaded by a parasol of colossal
dimensions, held in position by his secretary.</p>

<p>In spite of the extravagant terms of friendship which fell
from the Tarjum's lips, I was convinced, by close observation
of the man's face, that his words were insincere and that
it would be unsafe to trust him. He never looked us straight
in the face; his eyes were fixed on the ground all the time,
and he spoke in a despicably affected manner. I did not
like the man from the very first, and, friend or no friend, I
kept my loaded rifle on my lap.</p>

<p>After endless ponderous speeches, clumsy compliments,
and tender inquiries after all relations they could possibly
think of; after tiring parabolic sentences with fine sounds
but no meaning; after repeated blowing of the nose and
loud coughing, which always came on opportunely when we
asked whether they had yet come to a conclusion as to what
we should be allowed to do, at last, when my patience was
nearly exhausted, our negotiations of the previous day were
reopened. We argued for hours. We asked to be allowed
to go on. They were still uncertain whether they would let
us or not. To simplify matters, and hasten their decision
before other reinforcements arrived, the doctor applied for
permission to let only eight of us proceed to Mansarowar.
He (the doctor) himself would remain at Gyanema with</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_170" id="Pg_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>
the remainder of the party as a guarantee of good faith.
But even this offer they rejected, not directly, but with
hypocritical excuses and delays, for they thought we would
not find our way, and that if we did, we should find it
very rough, and the climate too severe; that the brigands
might attack us, and so on, and so on. All this was
very tiresome, and there were signs even of a nasty side to
their attitude. I decided to know what I was about.</p>

<p>Still holding the rifle cocked at safety on my lap, I turned
the muzzle of it towards the Tarjum, and purposely let my
hand slide down to the trigger. He became uncomfortable
and his face showed signs of wild terror. His eyes, until
now fixed upon the ground, became first unsteady, and then
settled fixedly, and with a look of distress, on the muzzle of
my rifle. At the same time he tried to dodge the aim right
or left by moving his head, but I made the weapon follow
all his movements. The Tarjum's servants fully shared
their master's fear. Without doubt the poor fellow was in
agony; his tone of voice, a moment before boisterous and
aggressive, now dwindled into the humblest intonations
imaginable. With much meekness he expressed himself
ready to please us in every way.</p>

<p>&quot;I see that you are good people,&quot; said he in a faint whisper,
accompanied by a deep bow. &quot;I cannot give, as I would
like to do, my official sanction to your journey forward, but
you can go if you wish. I cannot say more. Eight of you
can proceed to the sacred Mansarowar Lake. The others
will remain here.&quot;</p>

<p>Before giving his final decision he said that he would
prefer to have another consultation with his officers.</p>

<p>We accorded this readily.</p>

<p>The Tarjum then presented the doctor with a roll of
Tibetan cloth.</p>

<p>I had bathed as usual in the morning, and my Turkish
towel was spread outside the tent to dry. The Tarjum, who
showed great interest in all our things, took a particular
fancy to its knotty fabric. He sent for his child to see this
wonderful material, and when he arrived the towel was
placed on the youth's back as if it were a shawl. I at once
offered it to him as a present if he would accept it. There
were no bounds to his delight, and our relations, somewhat
strained a few minutes earlier, became now of the friendliest
character. We invited the party inside our tent, and they
examined everything with curiosity, asking endless questions.
They were now quite jovial and pleasant, and even
occasionally amusing. Tibetans have a craving for alcohol at</p>

all times and they soon asked me if I had any to give them;
there was nothing they would like more. As I never carry
any when travelling, I could not offer them any recognised
drink, but not wishing to disappoint them, I produced a
bottle of methylated spirits (which I used for my hypsometrical
apparatus). This they readily drank, apparently
appreciating its throat-burning qualities, and asked for
more. The Tarjum complained of an ailment from which
he had suffered for some time, and the doctor was able
to give him a suitable remedy, and all the other officers
received small presents when they departed.</p>

<p>In the afternoon a messenger came from the Barca Tarjum.
He had good news for us. The Tarjum wished us
to understand that &quot;as we had been so kind to him and his
followers, he regarded us as his personal friends; and as we
were so anxious to visit the Mansarowar Lake and the great
Kelas Mount, and had already experienced many difficulties
and great expense in coming so far, he agreed to eight of
our party proceeding to the sacred spots. It was impossible
for him to give an official consent, but he repeated again
that we could go if we wished.&quot;</p>

<p>This news naturally delighted me. Once at Kelas, I
felt sure I could easily find some means of going
farther.</p>

<p>On the same evening, a traitor in our camp sneaked from
under the tent in which my men were sleeping, and paid a
visit to the Tarjum. There is no doubt that he told him
I was not the doctor's brother, nor a Hindoo pilgrim.
He disclosed that I was a sahib, and that I was on my way
to Lhassa. From what I heard afterwards, it seemed that
the Tarjum did not quite believe his informant; but fresh
doubts arising in his mind, he sent a message during the
night, entreating us to return the way we came.</p>

<p>&quot;If there is really a sahib in your party, whom you have
kept concealed from me, and I let you go on, my head will
be cut off by the Lhassa people. You are now my friends,
and you will not allow this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell the Tarjum,&quot; I replied to the messenger, &quot;that he
is my friend, and I will treat him as a friend.&quot;</p>

<p>In the morning, we found thirty horsemen fully armed
posted some hundred yards from our tent. To proceed
with the demoralised crowd under me, and be followed by
this company, would certainly prove disastrous and I felt
again that some ruse was a necessity.</p>

<p>Much to the astonishment and terror of the armed force
and their superiors, the doctor, Chanden Sing and I, rifles
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_173" id="Pg_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
in hand, walked firmly towards the contingent of sepoys.
After us came the trembling coolies. The Magbun and the
Tarjum's officers could hardly believe their eyes. The
soldiers quickly dismounted, and laid their arms down to
show that they had no intention of fighting. We passed them
without any notice. The Magbun ran after me. He begged
me to stop one moment. Dola was summoned to interpret
his elaborate speech. A pair of prettily embroidered cloth-boots
were produced from the loose folds of the official's
coat, and he offered them with the following words:</p>

<p>&quot;Though your face is sunburnt and black, and your eyes
are sore (they were not, as a matter of fact, but I wore snow-spectacles),
your features tell me that you are of a good
family, therefore, you must be a high officer in your
country. Your noble feelings also show that you would
not have us punished for your sake, and now our hearts
are glad to see you retrace your steps. Let me offer you
these boots, so that your feet may not get sore on the long
and difficult journey back to your native land.&quot;</p>

<p>It was neatly put, though the mode of reasoning was
peculiar. It was not to my interest to disillusionise the
Tibetan as to my purpose, so I accepted the boots. The
Magbun and his guard salaamed to the ground.</p>

<p>Without further parleying, we left the Magbun, and
retracing our steps, proceeded in a W.S.W. direction as
though we had decided to turn back, and leave the country.</p>

<h5>Spying our movements&mdash;Disguised sepoys&mdash;A gloomy look-out&mdash;Troublesome
followers&mdash;Another march back&mdash;An
amusing incident.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> reached the summit of the hill and crossed to the other
side. My men went on down the slope, but I remained,
screened by a large stone, to observe with my telescope the
folks at Gyanema. No sooner had my last man disappeared
on the other side of the pass, than the cavalrymen jumped
into their saddles and, raising clouds of dust, galloped after
us. This was what I had expected. I hastened to rejoin my
men. When down in the plain, I again took my telescope,
and watched the sky-line of the hill we had just descended.
Some thirty heads could be seen peeping over the rocks
from among the boulders. The soldiers had evidently
dismounted, and were spying our movements. I felt
annoyed that they did not openly follow us, if they so
wished, instead of watching us from a distance, so I
sighted my rifle to eight hundred yards, lay down flat,
and took aim at a figure I could see more plainly than the
others.</p>

<p>The doctor snatched the rifle from my shoulder.</p>

<p>&quot;You must not shoot,&quot; said he, with his usual calmness;
&quot;you might kill somebody.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I only wish to teach these cowards a lesson.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That is all very well. But every man in Tibet is so
cowardly that the lesson would have to be constantly
repeated,&quot; answered Wilson with his perpetual wisdom.</p>

<p>I slung my rifle over my shoulder and made up my mind
to start some other time on the cyclopean task I had then
so nearly begun.</p>

<p>When we had covered a mile or so of the plain, our
phantomlike escort crossed the pass, and came full gallop
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_175" id="Pg_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
down the hill. I gave orders to my men to halt, seeing
which, the soldiers also came to a dead stop. I watched
them through the telescope. They seemed to be holding
a discussion. At last five men rode full speed northwards,
probably to guard the track in that direction. Three
men remained where they were, and the remainder, as if
seized by panic, galloped frantically up the hill again, and
disappeared over the summit.</p>

<p>We resumed our march. The three horsemen followed a
course one mile south of ours, close against the foot of
the hills, and lying low upon their ponies' heads, they
probably imagined that they were passing us unperceived.
Seeing that our bearings were for our old camp at Lama
Chokden, they left our line and rode ahead of us.</p>

<p>When in the evening we reached Lama Chokden, two
shepherds came to greet us. Then another appeared.</p>

<p>&quot;Our sheep are far away,&quot; said they. &quot;We are hungry.
We are poor. Can we stop near your camp and pick up the
food that you will throw away?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Certainly,&quot; I replied. &quot;But mind you do not pick up
anything else.&quot;</p>

<p>These simple folk, thinking I should not know them, had
left their ponies at the Lama Chokden guard-house, and,
disguised as shepherds, they were now trying to ingratiate
themselves with us, with the object of discovering our movements
and plans. They were, of course, no other than the
three sepoys from Gyanema.</p>

<p>At each step in our retreat towards the Himahlyas my
heart became heavier and my spirits more depressed. I
was full of stratagems, but to think out plans and to carry
them into effect were two different things.</p>

<p>How many times had not my schemes been upset? How
often had I not had to begin afresh when all seemed ready
and in perfect working order?&mdash;that, too, when I had
plenty of good material at my disposal to work upon.
Now things had changed altogether for the worse. My
chances of success, notwithstanding my incessant struggle,
were getting smaller and smaller every day. I could not
but feel that there must be an end eventually to the capability
and endurance of my followers and myself. It is
hard enough to start on a difficult task, but when you are
well started, and have already overcome many difficulties, to
have to come back and begin again is more than galling.</p>

<p>The outlook was dark and gloomy; I stood face to face
with apparent failure, and I was uncertain of the loyalty of
my own men.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_176" id="Pg_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>
At this camp, for instance, the Daku (brigand), who had
changed his disguise several times since coming in contact
with the Tibetans, announced his immediate departure.
The doctor, with his usual kindness, had already entreated
him to remain, but without avail. We well knew that in
this region, infested by dacoits, this man was only leaving us
to recommence his late marauding habits. He would, in all
probability, join some band, and without much doubt we
might soon expect a visit during the darkest hours of the
night. The Daku knew that I carried a large sum of money,
and during the last two days his behaviour had been
more than strange. Had he come across some of his
mates? or had he heard from the sepoys that they were in
the neighbourhood?</p>

<p>The Daku had a bundle of his blankets strapped on his
back in readiness for immediate departure. My men,
distressed at this new danger, came to report it to me. I
immediately sent for him. Speaking bluntly, and keeping
his eyes fixed on the ground, he said: &quot;I am going,
sahib.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Where?&quot; I inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;I have friends near here, and I am going to them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good, go,&quot; I replied, calmly taking up my rifle.</p>

<p>His load was off his shoulder in less time than it takes to
describe the event. He resumed his work as usual. One
or two other riotous coolies were brought back to reason
by similar menaces.</p>

<p>I heard later that a band of brigands attacked a party near
the frontier only two days after this occurred.</p>

<p>Another march back! How painful it was to me! Yet
it was advisable. We went a few miles and encamped on
the bank of a rapid stream, the Shirlangdu. From this
point, with some difficulty and danger, it would be possible
to climb over the mountain range during the night, and
attempt to elude the spies and watchmen, by crossing the
jungle to Mansarowar. I made up my mind to attempt
this. It seemed to add to the risk to have so large a
following as my thirty men, so I decided that only four or
five should accompany me. Going alone was impracticable,
because of the difficulty of carrying sufficient food, or I
would have by far preferred it. Nevertheless, if the worst
came to the worst, I resolved to attempt this latter mode of
travelling, and rely on the chance of obtaining food from
Tibetans.</p>

<p>All the loads were made ready. Articles of clothing and
comfort, niceties in the way of food, and extras in the way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_177" id="Pg_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
of medicines, were left behind to make room for my
scientific instruments.</p>

<p>Each pound in weight more that I dedicated to science
meant a pound less food to take us to Lhassa. Everything
that was not of absolute necessity had to be left.</p>

<p>Two Tibetan spies came to camp in the afternoon, in the
disguise, as usual, of beggars. They asked for food, and
exacted it. Their manner was unbearably insulting. This
was a little too much for us, and Bijesing the Johari, and
Rubso the Christian cook, were the first to enter into an
open fight with them! They punched and kicked them,
driving them down a steep ravine leading to a river, then,
assisted by other men in camp, showered stones upon them.
The unfortunate intruders, unable to wade quickly across
the rapid stream, received as fine a reception as they
deserved.</p>

<p>This little skirmish amused the camp, but many of the
Shokas and Hunyas in my service were still scared out of
their wits. It was quite sufficient for them to see a Tibetan
to crumble into nothing.</p>

<h5>An attempt that failed&mdash;A resolution&mdash;A smart Shoka lad&mdash;The
plucky Chanden Sing proposes to accompany me&mdash;Mansing
the leper becomes my servant's servant.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> hour fixed for my flight was 9 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Five men had
been induced to follow me by the offer of a handsome
reward.</p>

<p>At the hour appointed no single one of them had put in
an appearance. I went in search of them. One man had
purposely injured his feet and was disabled, another pretended
to be dying, the others positively refused to come.
They were shivering with fright and cold.</p>

<p>&quot;Kill us, sahib, if you like,&quot; they implored of me, &quot;but
we will not follow you.&quot;</p>

<p>At 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> all attempts to get even one man to carry a
load had proved futile. I had to abandon the idea of
starting.</p>

<p>My prospects became more gloomy than ever. Another
march back towards the cold and dreary pass by which I
had entered Tibet!</p>

<p>&quot;You are depressed, Mr. Landor,&quot; remarked the doctor.</p>

<p>I admitted the fact. Every step backwards was to me
like a stab in the heart. I had wished to push on at all
costs, and it was only in consideration of my good and
kind friend, the doctor, that I had reluctantly refrained
from making my way by force. My blood was boiling. I
felt feverish. The cowardice of my men made them
absolutely contemptible, and I could not bear to see them
even.</p>

<p>Immersed in my thoughts, I walked quickly on, and the
rugged way seemed short and easy. I found a suitable spot
for our next camp. Here before me, and on every side,
stood high snowy mountains; there, in front, towered that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_179" id="Pg_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
same Lumpiya Pass by which I had crossed into Tibet
with such high hopes. I detested the sight of it on the
present occasion; its snowy slopes seemed to mock at my
failure.</p>

<p>Whether it is that storms invariably come when one is
depressed, or whether one gets depressed when storms are
coming, I am not here prepared to say, but the fact remains
that, before we had time to pitch our tents, the wind, which
had been high all through the afternoon, increased tenfold.
The clouds above were wild and threatening, and snow soon
fell in feathery flakes.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you going to do?&quot; inquired the doctor of
me. &quot;I think you had better return to Garbyang, get fresh
men, and make another start.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, doctor. I will die rather than continue this backward
march. There will be a far better chance if I go
alone, and I have resolved to start to-night, for I am convinced
that I shall find my way over the range.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, no, it is impossible, Mr. Landor,&quot; cried the doctor,
with tears in his eyes. &quot;That must mean death to any one
attempting it.&quot;</p>

<p>I told him that I was quite determined.</p>

<p>The poor doctor was dumbfounded. He knew that it
was useless to try to dissuade me. I went into the tent to
rearrange and reduce my baggage, making a load small
enough to carry on my back, in addition to the daily
kit and instruments.</p>

<p>Whilst I was making preparations for my journey, Kachi
Ram entered the tent. He looked frightened and perplexed.</p>

<p>&quot;What are you doing, sir?&quot; inquired he hurriedly.
&quot;The doctor says you are going to leave alone to-night,
cross the mountain range, and go to Lhassa by yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that is true.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sir! The perils and dangers are too great, you
cannot go.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, but I am going to try.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sir! Then I will come with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, Kachi. You will suffer too much. Go back to
your father and mother now that you have the opportunity.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, sir; where you go, I will go. Small men never
suffer. If they do it does not matter. Only great men's
sufferings are worth noticing. If you suffer, I will suffer.
I will come.&quot;</p>

<p>Kachi's philosophy touched me. I ascertained beyond
doubt that he meant what he said, and then decided to take
him.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_180" id="Pg_180"></a>[<a href="./images/180.png">180</a>]</span>
This was a piece of luck. Kachi Ram had five bosom
friends among the young Shoka coolies. They were all
friends of the Rambang, and in the evenings in camp they
often used to join and sing weird songs in honour of the
fair maids of their hearts, whom they had left on the other
side of the Himahlyas.</p>

<p>Kachi hurried away in a state of feverish excitement. He
was back in a few minutes.</p>

<p>&quot;How many coolies will you take, sir?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;None will come.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I will get them. Will five do?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; I murmured incredulously.</p>

<p>My scepticism sustained a shock when Kachi returned,
buoyant, saying in his peculiar English:</p>

<p>&quot;Five Shokas come, sir. Then you, sir, I, sir, five coolies,
sir, start night-time, what clock?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;By Jove, Kachi,&quot; I could not help exclaiming, &quot;you are
a smart lad.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Smart,' sir?&quot; inquired he sharply, hearing a new
word. He was most anxious to learn English, and he had a
mania for spelling. &quot;'Smart!' What is meaning? How
spell?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S-m-a-r-t. It means 'quick, intelligent.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Smart,&quot; he repeated solemnly, as he wrote the newly-acquired
word in a book which I had given him for the
purpose. Kachi was undoubtedly, in spite of some small
faults, a great character. He was a most intelligent, sharp,
well-meaning fellow. His never failing good humour, and
his earnest desire to learn and to be useful, were quite
refreshing.</p>

<p>My luck seemed to have turned indeed. A few minutes
later my bearer, quite unaware that any one would accompany
me, entered the tent, and exclaimed in a disgusted
manner:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Shoka crab, sahib! Hunya log bura crab. Hazur hum,
do admi jaldi Lhasa giao</i>.&quot; (&quot;The Shokas are bad. The
Hunyas are very bad. Your honour and I, we two alone,
will go quickly by ourselves to Lhassa.&quot;)</p>

<p>Here was another plucky and useful man anxious to come.
He professed to have no fear of death. He was the type of
man I wanted. How true the poor fellow's protestations
were I learned at a later date!</p>

<p>Chanden Sing was a man of strong sporting proclivities.
His happiness was complete when he could fire his rifle at
something, though he was never known to hit the mark.
He had been severely reprimanded and punished by me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_181" id="Pg_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
only a few days before for wasting several cartridges on
<i>kiang</i> (wild horse) three miles distant. Ordinary work, however,
such as doing his own cooking, or keeping my things
tidy, was distasteful to him, and was invariably passed on to
others.</p>

<p>Mansing the leper, being unfortunately of the same caste
as Chanden Sing, became my servant's servant. The two
Hindoos constantly quarrelled and fought, but at heart they
were the best of friends. The bearer, by means of promises,
mingled at intervals with blows, eventually succeeded in
inducing his <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> to join in our new plan, and face with
us the unknown dangers ahead.</p>

<h5>&quot;Devil's Camp&quot;&mdash;A fierce snowstorm&mdash;Abandoning our tents&mdash;Dangers
and perils in prospect&mdash;Collecting the men&mdash;One
load too many!&mdash;Another man wanted and found&mdash;A propitious
night&mdash;Good-bye to Wilson&mdash;The escape&mdash;Brigands.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> eight o'clock in the evening I had collected all the men
who had promised to follow me. They comprised my
bearer, Kachi and six coolies.</p>

<p>We named this camp &quot;Devil's Camp,&quot; for diabolical indeed
was the wind that shook our tents, not to speak of the snow
blown into our shelters by the raging storm. During the
night the wind grew in fury. Neither wood, dung, nor
lichen for fuel was to be found. Our tents were pitched
at 16,900 feet above sea-level, and to ascend to the summit
of the range would mean a further climb of two thousand
feet. In such weather the difficulties of the ascent were
increased tenfold, though for evading the vigilance of the
Tibetan watchmen, who spied upon our movements, we
could have no better chance than a dirty night like this.
I arranged with the doctor that he was to take back to
Garbyang all the baggage I had discarded and the men who
had declined to follow me. He must display all our tents until
late in the afternoon of the next day, so as to let the Tibetans
suppose that we were all under them, and give me time to
make a long forced march before they could get on our
track. Hard as it would be for us going forward, we would
take no tent except the small <i>tente d'abri</i>, weighing about
four pounds. We should anyhow be unable to pitch one for
several days, for fear of being detected by the Tibetans, who
would be soon seen abroad in search of us. We should
have to march long distances at night, keeping mostly on
the summit of the range, instead of proceeding, like other
travellers, along the valleys, and we must get what little</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_184" id="Pg_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
sleep we could during the day, when we could hide in
some secluded spot. The thought of seeing a fire had
to be abandoned for an indefinite period, because, even in
the remote contingency of our finding fuel at the great
altitudes where we should have to camp, every one knows
that a fire and a column of smoke can be seen at a very
great distance, both by day and night. We pondered and
discussed all these matters before we made a start, and,
moreover, we were fully aware that, if the Tibetans could
once lay their hands upon us, our numbers were too small
to offer a stout resistance, and we might well give ourselves
up for lost. In fact, taking things all round, I rather doubted
whether the lives of my few followers and my own were
worth more than a song from the moment of our leaving
&quot;Devils' Camp.&quot;</p>

<p>With this full knowledge of what we were undertaking,
we may have been foolish in starting at all, but lack of
determination cannot in fairness be credited as one of our
faults.</p>

<p>The thoughtful doctor had brought with him from our
last camp a few lichens, with which he was now attempting
to light a fire, to cook me some <i>chapatis</i> before leaving.
Alas! four hours' hard work, and an equal number of
boxes of matches, failed to produce the semblance of a
flame.</p>

<p>At midnight I sent Chanden Sing and Kachi to collect
the men. Two came trembling into the tent; the others
could not be roused. I went myself and took them, one by
one, to their loads. They were all crying like children. It
was then that I discovered that in the haste and confusion I
had made one load too many. Here was a dilemma! Everything
was ready and propitious for our flight, and a delay at
this juncture was fatal. At any cost, I must have another
man.</p>

<p>The moans and groans in the coolies' tent, when I went
in search of one, were pitiful. You would have thought that
they were all going to die within a few minutes, and that
they were now in their last agonies, all because of the terror
of being picked out to follow me.</p>

<p>At last, after endless trouble, threats and promises, Bijesing
the Johari was persuaded to come. But the load was too
heavy for him; he would only carry half. To save trouble,
I agreed I would carry the other half myself in addition to
my own load.</p>

<p>We put out our hurricane lantern, and at 2 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, when the
gale was raging at its height, driving the grit and snow like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_185" id="Pg_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
spikes into our faces; when the wind and cold seemed
to penetrate with biting force to the marrow of our bones,
when, as it seemed, all the gods were giving vent to their
anger by putting every obstacle in our way, a handful of
silent men, half frozen and staggering, left the camp to face
the blizzard. I ordered my men to keep close together,
and we made immediately for the mountain side, taking care
to avoid the places where we supposed the Tibetan spies
were posted.</p>

<p>We could not have selected a more suitable night for our
escape. It was so dark that we could only see a few inches
in front of our noses. The doctor, silent and with a swelling
heart, accompanied me for a couple of hundred yards. I
urged him to return to the tent. He stopped to grasp my
hand, and in a broken voice the good man bade me farewell
and God-speed.</p>

<p>&quot;The dangers of your journey,&quot; whispered Wilson, &quot;are
so great and so numerous that God alone can guide you
through. When I think of the cold, hunger and hardships
you will have to endure, I can but tremble for you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye, doctor,&quot; said I, deeply moved.</p>

<p>&quot;Good-bye,&quot; he repeated, &quot;good&mdash;&mdash;&quot; and his voice
failed him.</p>

<p>Two or three steps and the darkness separated us, but his
touching words of farewell rang and echoed in my ears, as
with sadness I remembered the loyalty and cheerful kindness
of this good friend. The journey towards Lhassa had
recommenced in grim earnest. In a short while our ears,
fingers, and toes were almost frozen, and the fast driving
snow beat mercilessly against our faces, making our eyes
ache. We proceeded like so many blind people, speechless
and exhausted, rising slowly higher on the mountain range,
and feeling our way with our feet. As we reached greater
altitudes it grew still colder, and the wind became more
piercing. Every few minutes we were compelled to halt
and sit close together in order to keep warm and get breath,
as the air was so rarefied that we could barely proceed
under our heavy loads.</p>

<p>We heard a whistle, and sounds like distant voices. My
men collected round me, whispered, &quot;<i>Dakus, dakus!</i>&quot;
(&quot;Brigands, brigands!&quot;), and then threw themselves flat on
the snow. I loaded my rifle and went ahead, but it was
vain to hope to pierce the obscurity. I listened. Yet
another shrill whistle!</p>

<p>My Shokas were terrified. The sound seemed to come
from straight in front of us. We slightly altered our course,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_186" id="Pg_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
winning our way upward slowly and steadily, until we
found at sunrise we were near the mountain top. It was
still snowing hard. One final effort brought us to the
plateau on the summit.</p>

<p>Here we felt comparatively safe. Thoroughly exhausted,
we deposited our burdens on the snow, and laid ourselves
down in a row close to one another to keep ourselves warm,
piling on the top of us all the blankets available.</p>

<h5>S.E. wind&mdash;Hungry and half frozen&mdash;Lakes at 18,960 feet
above sea-level&mdash;Cold food at high altitudes&mdash;Buried in snow&mdash;Mansing's
sufferings&mdash;Fuel at last.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">At 1 p.m.</span> we woke up, drenched to the skin, the sun having
thawed the thick coating of snow over us. This camp
was at 18,000 feet. The wind from the S.E. cut like a
knife, and we suffered from it, not only on this occasion,
but every day during the whole time we were in Tibet. It
begins to blow with great fierceness and regularity at
one o'clock in the afternoon, and it is only at about eight
in the evening that it sometimes abates and gradually
ceases. Frequently, however, the wind, instead of dropping
at this time, increases in violence, blowing with terrible
vehemence during the whole night. As we were making
ready to start again, with limbs cramped and stiff, the
sky once more became suddenly covered with heavy grey
clouds, and fresh snow fell. There was no possibility
of making a fire, so we started hungry and half-frozen,
following a course of 70&deg; (b.m.). We waded up to our
waists through a freezingly cold stream, and climbing
steadily higher and higher for six miles, we at last reached
another and loftier plateau to the N.E. of the one where
we had camped in the morning. The altitude was 18,960
feet, and we were surprised to find four lakes of considerable
size close to one another on this high tableland.
The sun, breaking for a moment through the clouds, shone
on the snow-covered tops of the surrounding mountains,
silvering the water of the lakes, and making a beautiful and
spectacular picture, wild and fascinating in effect.</p>

<p>Hunger and exhaustion prevented full appreciation of the
scene; nothing could stand in the way of quickly finding
a suitable place to rest our weak and jaded bodies, under
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_188" id="Pg_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
the shelter of the higher hills round the plateau, or in some
depression in the ground. I was anxious to push across
the plateau, and descend on the N.E. side to some lower
altitude where we should more probably find fuel, but my
men, half-starved and fagged, could go no farther. Their
wet loads were considerably heavier than usual, they panted
terribly owing to the great altitude, and no sooner had we
come to a partially sheltered spot between the larger lake
and its most eastern neighbouring sheet of water, than they
all collapsed and were unable to proceed. I was much
concerned about them, as they refused to take any cold
food, saying it would cause their death. I was really at a
loss to see how they could recover sufficient strength for
the next day's marching. Eventually, by personally pledging
them that they would not die, I persuaded them to eat a
little <i>sato</i> and <i>ghur</i>. Unfortunately, no sooner had they
eaten some of it mixed with cold water, than nearly all were
seized with violent pains in their stomachs, from which they
suffered for the greater part of the night.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that experience had taught them that
eating cold food at great altitudes is more dangerous than
eating no food at all, and I regretted my ill-timed, if kindly
meant advice. One is apt to judge other people by oneself,
and personally I never felt any difference, whether my food
was cold or hot.</p>

<p>Soon after sunset the cold was intense. It was still
snowing hard, and our wet garments and blankets were
now freezing. I lighted a small spirit lamp, round which
we all sat close together, and covered over with our frozen
wraps. I even attempted to cook on the flame some concentrated
broth, but, owing to the high altitude, the water
was a long time losing its chill, apart from boiling, and
when it was just getting tepid the flame went out, and I
could afford no more spirits of wine to light it again: so the
cooking had to be abandoned, and as the night grew colder
and colder, we huddled together under our respective
blankets in a vain attempt to sleep. We had made a protecting
wall with our baggage, and my men covered their
heads and everything with their blankets; but I never could
adopt their style of sleeping, as it seemed to suffocate me.
I always slept with my head uncovered, for not only was it
more comfortable, but I wished to be on the alert should
we at any time be surprised by Tibetans. My men
moaned, groaned, and chattered their teeth convulsively
during the night. I woke many times with a bad pain
in my ears from frostbite; my eyes, too, suffered as the</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_190" id="Pg_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
eyelashes became covered with icicles. Every time I tried
to open them there was an uncomfortable feeling as if the
eyelashes were being torn off, for the slit of the eye became
fast frozen directly the lids were closed.</p>

<p>At last the morning came! The night had seemed endless.
When I tried to raise the blanket in order to sit up,
it seemed of an extraordinary weight and stiffness. No
wonder! It was frozen hard, and as rigid as cardboard,
covered over with a foot of snow. The thermometer
during the night had gone down to 24&deg;. I called my men.
They were hard to wake, and they, too, were buried in
snow.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Uta, uta, uta!</i>&quot; (&quot;Get up, get up, get up!&quot;) I called,
shaking one by one, and brushing off as much snow as I
could.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Baroff bahut!</i>&quot; (&quot;There is much snow!&quot;) remarked one
as he put his nose outside his blanket, and rubbed his eyes,
smarting from the white glare around us. &quot;Salaam, sahib,&quot;
added he, as, having overcome his first surprise, he perceived
me, and he waved his hand gracefully up to his
forehead.</p>

<p>The others behaved in a similar manner. Kachi was, as
usual, the last one to wake.</p>

<p>&quot;O, Kachi,&quot; I shouted, &quot;get up!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>O, bahiyoh!</i>&quot; (&quot;O, father!&quot;) yawned he, stretching his
arms. Half asleep, half awake, he looked round as if in a
trance, muttering incoherent words.</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning, sir. Oh, much snow. Oh look, sir, two
kiangs there! What is 'kiang' in English?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wild horse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;'Wild' you spell w-i-l-d?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Here the note-book was produced from under his pillow,
and the word registered in it.</p>

<p>Odd creatures these Shokas! The average European,
half-starved and frozen, would hardly give much thought
to exact spelling.</p>

<p>Poor Mansing the leper suffered terribly. He groaned
through the whole night. I had given him one of my
wrappers, but his circulation seemed suspended. His face
was grey and cadaverous, with deep lines drawn by suffering,
and his feet were so frozen that for some time he could
not stand.</p>

<p>Again the Shokas would eat nothing, for snow was still
falling. We started towards the N.E. After a mile of flat
we began a steep descent over unpleasant loose <i>d&eacute;bris</i> and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_191" id="Pg_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
sharp rocks. The progress was rapid, but very painful.
Scouring the country below with my telescope, I perceived
shrubs and lichens far down in the valley to the N.E. and
also a tent and some sheep. This was unfortunate, for we
had to alter our course in order not to be seen. We again
climbed up to the top of the plateau and rounded unperceived
the mountain summit, striking a more Easterly route.
Towards sunset we began our descent from the latter point,
and we crossed the river with no great difficulty. Having
selected a nicely sheltered depression in the ground, we
pitched my little <i>tente d'abri</i> there, by the side of a pond of
melted snow. With natural eagerness, we all set out collecting
lichens and shrubs for our fires, and each man carried
into camp several loads of the drier fuel. In a moment
there were three big fires blazing, and not only were we able
to cook a specially abundant dinner and drown our past
troubles in a bucketful of boiling tea, but we also managed
to dry our clothes and blankets. The relief of this
warmth was wonderful, and in our comparative happiness
we forgot the hardships and sufferings we had so far
encountered. With the exception of a handful of <i>sato</i>,
this was the first solid meal we had had for forty-eight
hours. In those two days we had travelled twenty miles,
each of us carrying a weight averaging considerably over
sixty pounds.</p>

<p>We were at 16,500 feet, which seemed quite a low elevation
after our colder and loftier camping-grounds. The reaction
was quite pleasant, and for myself I contemplated
our future plans and possibilities with better hope. The
outlook had changed from our deepest depression to a condition
of comparative cheerfulness and content.</p>

<h5>Dacoits&mdash;No nonsense allowed&mdash;A much-frequented region&mdash;A
plateau&mdash;The Gyanema-Taklakot track&mdash;A dangerous
spot&mdash;Soldiers waiting for us&mdash;Burying our baggage&mdash;Out of
provisions&mdash;A fall into the Gakkon River&mdash;A bright idea&mdash;Nettles
our only diet.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> front of us, to the N.E., was a high mountain, then farther
towards the East, a narrow valley between two hill ranges,
while at 238&deg; (b.m.) a river passed through a picturesque
gorge in the direction of the Mangshan Mountain.</p>

<p>It was necessary for me to proceed along the valley to the
east, as we should thus save ourselves much trouble, time
and exertion, though there would be some risk of our meeting
Tibetans, especially bands of dacoits, with whom this
part of Nari Khorsum<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> is infested. We had, therefore, to
proceed cautiously, especially as my Shokas seemed no less
timid and afraid of these folks. We had hardly gone half a
mile over the undulating country, and I had stopped behind
my men to take some observations with my prismatic compass,
when my carriers suddenly threw themselves flat on the
ground and began to retreat, crawling on hands and knees.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Dakus, Dakus!</i>&quot; (&quot;Brigands, brigands!&quot;) they whispered,
as I got near them.</p>

<p>It was too late. We had been seen, and a number of
dacoits, armed with matchlocks and swords, came rapidly
towards us. It has always been my experience that, in such
cases, the worst thing to do is to run away, for nothing
encourages a man more than to see that his opponent is
afraid of him. I therefore loaded my Mannlicher, and my
bearer did likewise with the Martini-Henry. I gave orders
to the Shokas to squat down by their respective loads and
not stir an inch. We two strolled towards the fast
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_193" id="Pg_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
approaching band, now less than a hundred yards distant.
I shouted to them to stop, and Chanden Sing signalled that
they must go back; but they took no notice of our warnings,
and came on all the faster towards us. Undoubtedly they
thought that we were only Shoka traders, and looked, from
experience, to find an easy prey. Making ready to rush us
as soon as they got near enough, they separated with the
obvious intention of taking us on all sides.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Sheep Carrying Load</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>&quot;<i>Dushu! Dushu!</i>&quot; (&quot;Go back!&quot;) I cried angrily at
them, raising my rifle to my shoulder and taking a steady
aim at the leader. Chanden Sing followed suit with one of
the others, and this seemed to have a salutary effect on
them, for they immediately made a comical salaam and took
to their heels, Chanden Sing and I pursuing them for some
distance so as to get them well out of our way. Having
occupied a prominent position on a small mound, we discovered
that a short way off they had a number of mates
and some three thousand sheep, presumably their last loot.
We signalled that they must get away from our course, and
eventually, driving their booty before them, they scurried off
in the direction I indicated. When they were well clear of
us, and my Shokas, who thought their last hour had come,
had partly recovered from their fright, we proceeded on our
journey, entering the narrow valley between the two hill
ranges. That we were now in a much-frequented region
could be plainly seen from the numerous encamping-grounds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_194" id="Pg_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
alongside the stream. But our success of the morning
had raised our spirits, and we stepped out cheerily, keeping
to the left bank. A steepish climb brought us to a plateau
at an altitude of 16,400 feet, from which we obtained a fine
view of the snow range running from East to West from
the Mangshan Mountain to the Lippu Pass, and beyond to
the N.E. the four lofty peaks of Nimo Nangil, 25,360 feet,
22,200 feet, 22,850 feet, 22,670 feet. The highest peaks were
at 84&deg;, 92&deg;, 117&deg; (b.m.). This plateau sloped gently, and was
broken by many deep crevasses, conveying the water-flow
down into the Gakkon River.</p>

<p>On the lower portion of this plateau, and then along the
course of the river, a track ran from Gyanema to Taklakot
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Kardam and Dogmar, and another seldom-frequented
track to Mangshan, S.S.W. of this place. The edge of the
plateau was 15,800 feet above sea-level, and the river 550
feet lower.</p>

<p>This was for us a very dangerous spot, since, no doubt,
by this time the Tibetans must be aware that I had escaped
and was well on my way into their country. I knew
that soldiers and spies must be guarding all the tracks
and searching for us. This thoroughfare, being more
frequented than the others, was all the more insecure,
and we had to display great caution in order to avoid
detection. In Tibet, I may here note, the atmosphere is so
clear that moving objects can be plainly seen at exceptionally
long distances. I scoured the country with my
telescope, but I could see no one, so we went on. However,
my men considered it safer to descend into one of the
numerous creeks, where we should be less exposed, but
we had hardly reached the border of it when we heard
noises rising from the valley below.</p>

<p>Crawling on our stomachs, my bearer and I peeped over
the edge of the plateau. Some five hundred feet below
was a Tibetan encampment, with a number of yaks and
ponies grazing. Unnoticed, I watched them for some time.
There were several soldiers, most probably posted there on
the look-out for me. With my glass I recognised some of
the Gyanema men. We deemed it advisable to find a spot
where we could hide until night came. Then, making a
d&eacute;tour, we descended to the river, 15,250 feet, scrambled
across in the dark, and made our way up a narrow gorge
between high cliffs until we came to a well-hidden spot,
where I called a halt. Followed by my men, I climbed up
from rock to rock on the cliff to our left, and found a
small natural platform, sheltered by a huge boulder projecting</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_195" id="Pg_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.jpg">195</a>]</span></p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_196" id="Pg_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>
over it. This seemed a safe enough spot for us to
stop. We dared not put up a tent, and we took the precaution
of burying all our baggage in case of a surprise
during the night. Unhampered, we should at any moment
be able to hide ourselves away from our pursuers or run
before them, and we could always come back afterwards for
our things if an opportunity offered itself.</p>

<p>And now, just as everything seemed to be running
smoothly, I made a terrible discovery. At this stage of the
journey, when it was important for me to move very
rapidly, I found that we were out of provisions. This
was indeed an unpleasant surprise, for before leaving
the larger body of my expedition I had given orders to my
men to take food for ten days. The doctor, who had been
deputed to see to this, had assured me that the loads contained
quite enough to last us over that length of time, and
now for some unaccountable reason we had only sufficient
food for one meagre meal. Moreover, I discovered that we
had only a few grains of salt left.</p>

<p>&quot;What have you done with it?&quot; I inquired angrily, as it
immediately flashed across my mind that there had been
foul play among my carriers. I had ordered each man to
take half seer (1 lb.) of salt.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sahib, but we forgot to take it,&quot; said the men in a
chorus.</p>

<p>After the terrible hardships and fatigue we had gone
through, and the anxiety and difficulty of carrying on my
surveying, photography, sketching, writing, collecting, &amp;c.,
under conditions of unusual discomfort and risk, it was,
indeed, a hard blow to me to see all my plans thus unexpectedly
frustrated, for we were still three or four days'
journey from Mansarowar, where I relied on getting fresh
supplies. Having come thus far, should I be compelled
now to go back or give in, and be captured by the Tibetan
soldiers whom I had so successfully evaded? Though not
usually much affected by physical pain, I unfortunately suffer
greatly under any mental stress. I felt quite ill and depressed,
and, to add bodily discomfort to my moral sufferings, came
the fact that I had slipped, while jumping in semi-darkness
from stone to stone across the Gakkon River, and had
fallen flat into about four feet of water. The wind was very
high at the time, and the thermometer down to 26&deg;, so that,
sitting in my wet clothes to discuss our present situation
with my men, I suddenly became so cold, shivery and
exhausted, that I thought I was about to collapse altogether.
My usual good spirits, which had done much towards
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_197" id="Pg_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
carrying me so far, seemed extinguished; my strength
failed me entirely, and a high fever set in, increasing in
violence so fast that, notwithstanding my desperate struggle
not to give in, I became almost delirious. With my teeth
chattering and my temperature at its highest, I saw all my
troubles assume an exaggerated form, and failure seemed
inevitable. The more I ransacked my brain the more hopeless
seemed our position, until, when I was almost in despair,
an expedient suddenly flashed across my mind; an idea
more adapted for romance perhaps than real life, yet not,
I hoped, impossible to be carried into execution. Four of
my men should go disguised, two as traders and two as
beggars, into the Takla<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> fort, and purchase food from my
enemies. We remaining in camp would, in the meantime,
keep well hidden until they returned. I spoke to my
followers, and after some easily conceivable reluctance, four
Shokas undertook to perform, the daring duty. Discovery
would mean to them the loss of their heads, probably preceded
by cruel tortures of all kinds; so, though they
eventually betrayed me, I cannot help giving them credit
for the pluck and fidelity they displayed in the present
emergency.</p>

<p>During the night my men were extremely good to me.
We did not sleep for fear of being surprised by the Tibetan
soldiers, and we passed hour after hour listening to Shoka
stories of brigands and Tibetan tortures, terrible enough
not only to keep us awake, but to make every hair on our
heads stand on end. Early in the morning, when it grew
light, we gathered a quantity of nettles, which were to be
found in profusion at this camp, and having boiled them in
different fashions, we made of them a hearty if not an
appetising meal. They did not seem very unpalatable at
the time, only it was unfortunate that we had no more salt,
for that would have added to the digestibility of our prickly
diet. We supplied the deficiency by mixing with them a
double quantity of pepper, and it was a relief to know that,
while nettles existed near our camp, we should at least not
die of starvation.</p>

<h5>All that remained of my men's provisions&mdash;The plan to enter
the fort&mdash;Appearance of yaks&mdash;A band of brigands&mdash;Erecting
fortifications&mdash;Changes in the temperature&mdash;Soldiers in search
of us!</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> food supply for my men was now reduced in all to
four pounds of flour, two pounds of rice, and two pounds
of <i>sato</i>. This we gave to the four men who were to
attempt to enter Taklakot, for their road would be long and
fatiguing. For us, there were plenty of nettles to fall back
upon.</p>

<p>I carefully instructed the four Shokas how to enter the
Tibetan fort one by one in their disguises, and purchase, in
small quantities at a time, the provisions we required. When
a sufficient amount was obtained to make a load, a man
should immediately start towards our camp, and the others
were to follow separately for a few marches, when at a given
spot, they would all four meet again and return to us. It
was exciting work to prepare the different disguises and
arrange for everything, and at last, after repeated good-byes
and words of encouragement, the four messengers left on
their perilous errand. All seemed very quiet round us, so
quiet that I unburied my sextant and artificial horizon, and
was taking observations for longitude as well as for latitude
(by double altitudes, as the angle was too great to be
measured at noon), when, to our dismay, a herd consisting
of over a hundred yaks appeared on the pass, North of our
camp, and slowly advanced towards us. Were we discovered?
Were the Tarjum's men coming, preceded by their animals?
No time was to be lost; instruments and blankets were
quickly cleared away and hidden, and then, crawling up
towards the animals, who had stopped on perceiving us, we
threw stones at them in order to drive them down the next</p>

creek. As luck would have it, we were just in time to do
this, for from our hiding-place on the summit of the pass
we could see, on the other side, a number of Tibetans
following the yaks we had driven away. They passed only
a couple of hundred yards below us, evidently quite unconscious
of our presence. They were singing, and
apparently looking for somebody's tracks, for they often
stooped to examine the ground. Later in the afternoon
I went to reconnoitre down the Gyanema road, and in
the hope of watching, unseen, the Tibetans who passed
on their way to and from Taklakot. I saw no soldiers,
but a strong band of Jogpas (brigands), driving before them
thousands of sheep and yaks, was an interesting sight.
They all rode ponies, and seemed to obey their leader very
smartly, when in a hoarse voice, and never ceasing to turn his
prayer-wheel, he muttered orders. They went briskly along
in fine style, women as well as men riding their ponies
astride. The men had matchlocks and swords, and each
pony carried, besides its rider, bags of food slung behind
the saddle. I watched the long procession from behind
some rocks, and felt somewhat relieved when the last
horsemen, who passed only some twenty yards from me,
rode away with the rest of the caravan. I retraced my steps,
and judging that this camp was not quite so safe as I had at
first supposed, I proceeded, with the aid of my men, to
erect a rough entrenchment and wall round our platform,
along the rock under which we lived. These bulwarks
answered the double purpose of sheltering us from the
sight of the Tibetans and of acting as fortifications in case
of a night attack. All our things were buried a little way
above our camp.</p>

<p>Another long dreary day had elapsed. We had used our
last grain of salt; and yet another day on nettles alone;
and a third day and a fourth, on the same diet! How
sick we got of nettles! The days seemed endless as,
lying flat on a peak above our camp, I remained hour
after hour scanning with my telescope the long plateau
above the Gakkon River in search of our returning messengers.
Every time I perceived men in the distance my
heart leaped, but on focussing them with my glass they
turned out to be Jogpas (bandits), or Dogpas (nomad tribes
of smugglers), or travelling Humlis or Jumlis, on their way
to Gyanema and Gartok. And how many times did we
not listen and then anxiously peep through the fissures in
our fortifications when some unusual noise struck our ears!
As time went on, and they did not put in an appearance, we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_201" id="Pg_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
began to entertain doubts as to their safety, or would they
betray us and never return? Or, as was more likely, had
they been caught by the Jong Pen (the master of the fort),
and been imprisoned and tortured?</p>

<p>My bearer, who was somewhat of a <i>bon vivant</i>, declined
to eat any more food, as he said it was better not to eat
at all than to eat the same thing constantly. He swore he
could fast for ten days, and he made up for want of food
by sleeping.</p>

<p>My fortified abode was comfortable enough during the
morning, when the sun shone on it, though often it got so
warm that we had to abandon it in the middle of the day,
when the thermometer registered as much as 120&deg;, 122&deg;, and
even 124&deg;. From 1 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> till 10 at night a bitter wind blew
from the S.E., and seemed to get right into our bones; so
cold was it that the temperature suddenly dropped down to
60&deg;, and even lower, the moment the sun disappeared
behind the mountains, and continued to fall as low as 40&deg;,
34&deg; and 32&deg;; the minimum during the night. One night
we had a terrible gale and a snowstorm. Such was the
force of the wind, that our wall was blown down upon us
as we slept in its shelter, and the hours we had dedicated
to rest had to be spent in repairing the damage done.
On the following morning we were gathering nettles for
our meal, when we heard the distant tinkling of fast
approaching horse-bells. We quickly put out the fires, hid
our things, and hastened behind our entrenchment. I seized
my rifle; Chanden Sing loaded the Martini. A Shoka, who
was too far off to reach our fortified abode in time, screened
himself behind some rocks. In the nick of time! Half-a-dozen
sepoys with matchlocks, to which were attached red
flags, slung over their shoulders, were cantering gaily up the
hillside only a few yards in front of us. They were
undoubtedly searching for me, judging by the way they
looked in every direction, but fortunately they never turned
towards the castle walls that concealed us. They were
expecting, I presumed, to see a large European tent in one
of the valleys, and never even dreamt that we should be
where we were. We covered them well with our rifles,
but we had no occasion to fire. They rode on, and the
sound of their horse-bells grew fainter and fainter as they
disappeared behind the pass. To be sure these horsemen
could only be soldiers despatched by the Tarjum to guard
this track. They were now probably on their way back to
him, satisfied that the sahib was not to be found in that
part of the country.</p>

<h5>&quot;Terror Camp&quot;&mdash;Two more messengers leave camp&mdash;A tribe

Taklakot&mdash;The account and adventures of their mission&mdash;In
great distress&mdash;Two fakirs who suffered through me&mdash;Five
hundred rupees offered for my head&mdash;The Shokas want to

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> named this spot &quot;Terror Camp,&quot; for many and horrible
were the experiences that befell us here. Another weary
day dragged slowly to its close, and there was still no sign
of the messengers' return. Two men volunteered to go
into Kardam, a settlement some miles off, and try to obtain
food from the Tibetans. One of them had a friend at this
place, and he thought he could get from him sufficient
provisions to enable us to go on a few days longer.</p>

<p>They started, disguised as pilgrims, a disguise not
difficult to assume, for their clothes were falling to pieces
owing to the rough marching we had done of late. They
were away the whole day, and only returned late at night,
having an amusing tale to tell. Meeting a tribe of Dogpas,
they had boldly entered their camp, asking to purchase food.
Unfortunately the Dogpas had not sufficient for themselves,
and could not spare any. Incidentally my men were
informed that <i>Lando Plenki</i>&mdash;the name the Tibetans had
given me&mdash;had taken a large army of men into Tibet, and
that great excitement prevailed at Taklakot as well as at
other places, owing to the fact that the sahib had the
extraordinary power of making himself invisible when the
Tibetan soldiers were in his vicinity. He had been
reported as having been seen in many places in Tibet:
soldiers had been despatched in all directions to capture
him. His tracks had several times been discovered and
followed, and yet he could never be found. Messengers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_203" id="Pg_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
had been hastily sent out from Taklakot to Lhassa (sixteen
days' journey), and to Gartok, a great bazaar in West
Tibet, asking for soldiers to assist in the capture of this
strange invader, who was also said to have the power of
walking on the water when crossing the rivers, and of flying
over mountains when he chose. When I recalled our
struggles and sufferings in climbing over the mountains,
and in crossing the streams on our journey, this account
of myself given by the Tibetans, and now repeated to
me, struck me as almost cruelly ironical. Anyhow, I
was pleased that the Tibetans credited me with such
supernatural powers, for it could hardly fail to be an
advantage in keeping them from getting to too close
quarters with us.</p>

<p>Three more days had to be spent in a state of painful
uncertainty and anxiety regarding the fate of our messengers
to Taklakot. On the night of the 3rd we had retired to
our fortress in despair, fearing that they had been captured
and probably beheaded. It was 10 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, and we were worn
out and ready to turn in; our fire down below at the
bottom of the creek was slowly dying out, and nature
around us was still and silent, when I suddenly heard sounds
of approaching steps. We listened, peeping through the
fissures in our wall. Were these Tibetans trying to surprise
us in our sleep, or could they be our men returning at
last?</p>

<p>We closely watched the gorge from which the sounds
came, faint sounds of voices and of footsteps. Silent as
we were, there were not wanting signs of the nervous
excitement of my men. At last four staggering figures
crawled cautiously into camp, and we could not even then
discern in the dim light whether these were our messengers
or not.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Kuan hai?</i>&quot; (&quot;Who is there?&quot;) I shouted.</p>

<p>&quot;Dola!&quot; replied a voice, and instantly we gave them a
joyful and hearty greeting. But our happiness was not to
last long. The men did not respond. They seemed quite
exhausted, and apparently terrified. I asked them to
explain the cause of their distress, but, sobbing and embracing
my feet, they showed great disinclination to tell me.
Grave, indeed, was the news they brought, presaging much
trouble in store.</p>

<p>&quot;Your days are numbered, sahib,&quot; at last cried Dola.
&quot;It is impossible for you to get out of this country alive ... they
will kill you, and the Jong Pen of Taklakot says
that he must have your head at all costs.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_204" id="Pg_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>
&quot;Do not look so far ahead, Dola,&quot; I replied, trying to
calm him, &quot;but tell me first how you reached Taklakot.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sahib, we followed your plan. We suffered much
on the road, as the marches were long and severe, and we
had very little food. We walked day and night for two days,
keeping away from the track, and hiding whenever we
saw any one. When we got near the Tibetan fort, we saw
at the foot of the hill a few tents of the Tinker and Chongur
Shokas from Nepal. None of the Biassi or Chaudassi
Shokas had been allowed to enter Tibet owing to the Jong
Pen's anger with them regarding his claims for land
revenue. There was a guard day and night at the river, and
a sharp look-out was kept to stop and arrest anybody entering
the country. Two fakirs, who were on a pilgrimage
to the sacred Mansarowar, unaware of the danger, had
crossed over the Lippu Pass, and had proceeded down to
Taklakot, where they were immediately seized and accused
of being you, sahib, in disguise. As the Tibetans were not
quite certain as to which of the two was the real sahib, they
severely punished both, beating them almost to death.
What became of them afterwards we were unable to learn.
Anyhow, the Tibetans subsequently found out that you had
entered Tibet by another pass, and soldiers have been sent
in every direction to look for you.</p>

<p>&quot;No sooner did we appear at Taklakot,&quot; sobbed Dola,
&quot;than we were pounced upon, knocked about, and arrested.
They cross-examined us closely. We professed to be Johari
traders, who had run short of food, and had made for
Taklakot to buy provisions. They beat us and treated us
badly, until your friend Zeniram, the head village man of
Chongur (in Nepal), came to our rescue and gave thirty
rupees surety for us. We were then allowed to remain in
his tent, guarded by Tibetan soldiers. We secretly purchased
from him and packed the provisions, and at night
Zeniram succeeded in decoying the soldiers that were
guarding us into his tent, and gave them <i>ch&ouml;kti</i> to drink
until they became intoxicated. One by one we four succeeded
in escaping with our loads. For three nights we
marched steadily back, concealing ourselves during the day
for the sake of safety. Now we have returned to you, sahib.&quot;</p>

<p>Dola paused for a minute or two.</p>

<p>&quot;Sahib,&quot; he continued, &quot;we were told in Taklakot that
over a thousand soldiers are searching for you everywhere,
and more are expected from Lhassa and Sigatz,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> whither
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_205" id="Pg_205"></a>[<a href="./images/205.png">205</a>]</span>
the Jong Pen has hastily sent messengers. They fear you,
sahib, but they have orders from Lhassa to capture you at
all costs. They say that you can make yourself invisible
when you like, and exorcisms are made and prayers offered
daily, so that in future you may be seen and arrested.
Once caught, they will have no pity on you, and you will be
beheaded, for the Jong Pen is angry with you owing to the
defiant messages you sent him from Garbyang. He has
given orders to the soldiers to bring you back dead or alive,
and whoever brings your head will receive a reward of 500
rupees.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I had no idea that my head was so valuable,&quot; I could
not help exclaiming. &quot;I shall take great care of it in the
future.&quot;</p>

<p>As a matter of fact 500 rupees in Tibet represents a fortune,
and the man possessing it is a very rich man.</p>

<p>But my men were not in a laughing mood and they
looked upon the whole affair as very serious.</p>

<p>I gave a handsome backshish to the four men who had
brought the provisions, but that did not prevent all the
Shokas declaring that the danger was so great that they
must leave me there and then. Appeals are useless on such
occasions, and so I simply stated that I should shoot any
man attempting to leave camp. Having now provisions for
ten days, I informed them that we must at once push on.</p>

<p>Sulky and grumbling they left our fortified corner
and went below to the creek. They said they preferred
sleeping down there. I suspected them, however, and
I sat up watching them and listening instead of sleeping.
My bearer rolled himself up in his blanket and, as usual,
was soon asleep. The Shokas lighted a fire, sat round it,
and with their heads close together, held an excited council
in semi-whispers. In the heated discussion some spoke
louder than they imagined, and the night being particularly
still and the place well adapted for carrying sound, I overheard
words which put me on the alert, for I soon convinced
myself that they were arranging to sell my head ... yes ... and
to divide the money.</p>

<p>The men got closer together, and spoke so faintly, that I
could hear no more. Then they each in turn placed one
hand above the other along a stick, until the end of it was
reached; each man then passed it to his neighbour, who went
through the same form; a complicated manner of drawing
lots, common among the Shokas. Eventually the man
selected by fate drew from a load a large Gourkha <i>kukri</i>,
and removed its scabbard. A strange, almost fantastic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_206" id="Pg_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
impression remains on my mind of the moment when the
men, with their faces lighted by the small flame of the
flickering fire, all looked up towards my eyrie. The
culminating point of their treachery had come, and their
countenances seemed ghastly and distorted, as seen from
the fissure in the wall behind which I knelt. They
listened to hear if we were asleep. Then all but one
rolled themselves in their blankets, completely covering
their heads and bodies. The one figure I could
now see sat up by the fire for some time, as if absorbed
in thought. Every now and then he turned his head up
towards my fortress, and listened. At last he got up, and
with his feet smothered the fire. It was a lovely night, and
as soon as the reddish flame was put out the stars shone
again like diamonds in the small patch of deep blue sky
visible above my head.</p>

<p>I rested the barrel of my rifle on the wall, my eyes being
fixed on the black figure down below. I watched as,
stooping low, it crawled step by step the few yards up to
my abode, pausing to listen each time that a rolling stone
caused a noise. It was now only two or three yards
away, and seemed to hesitate. Drawing back, and ready
to spring up, I kept my eyes fixed on the top of the wall.
I waited some time, but the man was in no hurry, and I
grew impatient.</p>

<p>I slowly got up, rifle in hand, and as I raised my head
above the wall I found myself face to face with the man
on the other side. I lost no time in placing the muzzle of
my Mannlicher close to his face, and the perplexed Shoka,
dropping his <i>kukri</i>, went down on his knees to implore my
pardon. After giving him a good pounding with the butt
of my rifle, I sent him about his business. The man lacked
the qualities of a murderer, but I felt I had better see that
no other disturbance took place during the night. It is
true that two men attempted to crawl out of camp and
desert, but I discovered this and stopped them in time.
At last the sun rose, and the night ended with all its
troubles and anxieties.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>

<h5>A Tibetan guard's encampment&mdash;Nattoo volunteers to be a
guide&mdash;Treachery and punishment of the Shokas&mdash;All ways
forward barred to me&mdash;Evading the soldiers by another
perilous march at night&mdash;Mansing again lost&mdash;A marvellous
phenomenon&mdash;Sufferings of my men&mdash;Severe cold.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> my last scouting journey up the hill above the camp, I
had espied, by the aid of my telescope, the encampment of
a guard of Tibetans, about three miles north of us, and I
informed my followers of this fact.</p>

<p>In the morning, when we again dug up the main part of
our baggage and made ready to start, one of the men, the
Kutial Nattoo, came forward and professed to be able to
guide us directly to the Mansarowar Lake. He seemed very
anxious to undertake this task, saying that there would be
no chance of detection by the route he knew, and consequently
we might march during the daytime.</p>

<p>We started up the creek, led by this man, and I was
astonished at the willingness with which the Shokas
agreed to proceed. In a little time I felt convinced that
he was deliberately taking us to the spot I most wished to
avoid. On my remonstrating and stopping further progress
in that direction, the Shokas mutinied and, depositing their
loads, tried to escape, but my bearer quickly barred their
way ahead in the narrow creek and I prevented their escape
from the opposite side, so they had to surrender. Painful
as it was to me, I had to severely punish them all, and while
I took care that no one should bolt, Chanden Sing took
special pleasure in knocking them about until they were
brought back to their senses. On being closely cross-examined,
they openly confessed that they had made a plot
to hand me over to the Tibetan guard, in order to escape
the horrors of torture by the Tibetans. This last act of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_208" id="Pg_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span>
treachery, coming after what had happened during the night,
and from the very men whom I had just been more than
lenient towards, was too much for me, and I used a stick,
which Chanden Sing handed me, very freely on their backs
and legs, Nattoo the Kutial receiving the largest share of
blows, because he was undoubtedly the head of the conspiracy.</p>

<p>On climbing to a point of vantage, I now further discovered
that, besides the guard we had to the north of us, both east
and west our way was barred by Tibetan soldiers, and
although it was not possible to get on during the day
without being seen, I absolutely refused to go back south.
I held a palaver with my men, who were apparently resigned,
and they agreed to accompany me as far as the Maium Pass
(on the road to Lhassa), which we reckoned to be some
fifteen or eighteen marches. They further agreed to
endeavour to obtain yaks and food for me, and I was then
to dismiss them. From the summit of the hill I had
climbed, I had taken careful bearings, and when night came,
aided by my luminous compass, I led my men high up
along the mountain range at an average elevation of 1500
feet above the Gyanema-Taklakot track.</p>

<p>The night was dark and stormy, and we encountered
much difficulty in our journey forward owing to the slippery
ground, alternated with the ever troublesome loose
<i>d&eacute;bris</i> and shifting rocks. We could not see far ahead,
and though we well knew from the angle of the slope
that we were travelling along a precipice, we could not
distinguish anything under us except a peculiarly luminous
streak far, far down below&mdash;undoubtedly the river.</p>

<p>I could not explain this luminosity of the water, which
did not seem to come from reflection of the light of stars
or the moon, because the sky was very cloudy at the time.
Moreover, the river had a curious greenish tint quite
peculiar to itself, and closely resembling the light produced
by an electric spark. In the more dangerous spots we
had to proceed for long distances on all-fours, and even
then we felt hardly safe, for we could hear the rattling of
the stones rolling down the steep slope, and by this sound
we could judge that we were proceeding over a precipice of
extraordinary height. So difficult and painful was the
walking, that it took us four hours to go about three miles;
and we felt so exhausted, that from time to time we had to
lie down and rest, shivering with cold, and our hands
bleeding from cuts caused by the sharp stones. I mustered
my men. Poor Mansing the leper was missing. When
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_209" id="Pg_209"></a>[<a href="./images/209.png">209</a>]</span>
we last saw him he was moaning under his load, and
he constantly stumbled and fell. Two men were sent
in search, but after an hour's absence they failed to
discover him. The faithful Chanden Sing and the Shoka
Dola were then despatched, as I would not abandon the
poor wretch if by any means he could be saved. After
another hour of anxiety, the two returned, bringing the
unfortunate coolie with them. The poor fellow's hands
and feet were badly cut, and the pain in the latter was so
great that he could not stand erect. He had fallen fainting
from exhaustion, and it was by a mere stroke of luck
that in the darkness Chanden Sing stumbled against his
senseless body. Apart from his life, his loss would have
been a very serious matter for me, as he carried my bedding
and photographic cameras.</p>

<p>Sleet and rain commenced to fall, and the cold was
intense. We continued to climb steadily, Chanden Sing and
I helping the poor leper along. The march soon became
less difficult, as we were following a depression formed
by the action of melting snows, and were sheltered from
the piercing wind which had been hitherto driving the sleet
hard into our faces. We slowly covered some three miles
more, and during that time the storm passed away, leaving
the atmosphere beautifully clear. When we reached the
pass (over 17,000 feet), a curious optical phenomenon astonished
us all. The larger stars and planets, of a dazzling
brilliancy such as I had never in my life seen before,
seemed to swing to and fro in the sky with rapid and
sudden jerks, describing short arcs of a circle, and returning
each time to their normal position. The effect was
so weird, that the first thing that struck me was that something
had gone wrong with my vision, but my companions
saw the same phenomenon: another curious
thing was that the stars nearer the horizon disappeared
and reappeared behind the mountain range. The oscillations
of the heavenly bodies nearer the horizon were
less rapid, but the angle of the arc described measured
almost double that traced by the stars directly above our
heads. The oscillations of these, however, were very
much more rapid, especially at certain moments, when
the star itself could no more be discerned, and a continuous
line of light appeared on the deep blue background of the
sky. This strange optical illusion, which began soon after
the storm had entirely cleared away, lasted some time;
then the vibrations gradually became less violent, and stars
and planets eventually resumed their normal steadiness,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_210" id="Pg_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
and shone with great brilliancy and beauty. We crossed
the pass, and halted directly on the northern side of it,
for my men's feet were in such a condition that they
could bear the pain no longer. The minimum temperature
was but 12&deg;, and as we had no tent there was only a
blanket between us and heaven. When we woke in the
morning, we found the thermometer had risen to 30&deg;,
but we were enveloped in a thick mist which chilled us to
our very marrow. I had icicles hanging down my moustache,
eyelashes and hair, and my cheeks and nose were
covered with a thin layer of ice caused by the respiration
settling and congealing on my face.</p>

<h5>Night marching&mdash;The Lafan and Mafan Lakes&mdash;Tize, the
sacred Kelas&mdash;Rhubarb&mdash;Butterflies&mdash;A hermit Lama&mdash;More
Dacoits&mdash;Surrounded by them&mdash;Routed.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> our night marches, up and down mountain ranges
of considerable height, we naturally had adventures and
escapes far too numerous to relate here in exact detail, and I
shall not give a full description of each march on account
of the unavoidable monotony of such a narrative. In constant
storms of grit and snow we crossed range after range,
travelling during the night and hiding by day, camping at
very great altitudes and undergoing considerable privations.
I steered my men towards the Rakstal<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> Lake, and one day,
having risen to 17,550 feet, we obtained a magnificent view
of the two great sheets of water, the Lafan-cho and Mafan-cho,
or Rakstal and Mansarowar Lakes, by which latter
names they are more commonly known to non-Tibetans.</p>

<p>To the N. of the lakes stood the magnificent Tize, the
sacred Kelas mountain, overtopping by some two thousand
feet all the other snowy peaks of the Gangri chain, which
extended roughly from N.W. to S.E. From this spot we
could see more distinctly than from Lama Chokden the
band round the base of the mountain, which, according to
legend, was formed by the rope of the Rakas (devil) trying
to tear down this throne of the gods.</p>

<p>Tize, the great sacred peak, is of fascinating interest, owing
to its peculiar shape. It resembles, as I have said, the giant
roof of a temple, but to my mind it lacks the gracefulness of
sweeping curves such as are found in Fujiama of Japan, the
Most artistically beautiful mountain I have ever seen. Tize
is angular, uncomfortably angular, if I may be allowed the
expression, and although its height, the vivid colour of its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_212" id="Pg_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
base, and the masses of snow that cover its slopes, give
it a peculiar attraction, it nevertheless struck me as being
intensely unpicturesque, at least from the point from which
I saw it, and from which the whole of it was visible.
When clouds were round it, toning down and modifying its
shape, Tize appeared at its best from the painter's point
of view. Under these conditions, I have thought it very
beautiful, especially at sunrise, with one side tinted red and
yellow, and its rocky mass standing majestic against a background
of shiny gold. With my telescope I could plainly
distinguish, especially on the E. side, the defile along which
the worshippers make the circuit at the base of the mountain,
though I was told that some pilgrims actually march
round it on the snowy ledge directly over the base, and just
above the darker band of rock described before. On the S.W.
side can be seen, on the top of a lower peak, a gigantic Obo.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Our First View of Rakastal</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The peregrination round Tize usually takes three days,
though some accomplish it in two days, and under favourable
circumstances it has even been done in one day. It is
usual for the pilgrims to say certain prayers and make
sacrifices as they proceed, and the more fanatical perform
the journey serpentwise, lying flat on the ground; others,
again, do it on their hands and knees, and others walking
backwards.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_213" id="Pg_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
Tize, or Kelas, has an elevation of 21,830 feet, and Nandiphu,
W. of it, 19,440 feet, while N.W. of the sacred mountain
are visible other summits 20,460 feet, 19,970 feet, and
20,280 feet. Animal life seemed to abound, for while I
was sketching the panorama before me, a snow leopard
bounded gracefully past us. I had a shot or two at <i>thar</i>,
and we saw any number of <i>kiang</i>. We found rhubarb,
which seemed to be thriving, at so high an elevation
as 17,000 feet, and quantities of yellow flowers in the same
locality and at the same elevation; and at 19,000 feet I
netted two couples of small white and black butterflies.
They seemed to have great difficulty in flying, and hardly
rose more than two or three inches off the ground, flapping
their wings irregularly; they seldom flew more than a few
feet, and then remained motionless for long periods before
they attempted to fly again. I had come across the same
kind of butterfly at lower altitudes, 18,600 feet and 17,000
feet, and I invariably found them in couples.</p>

<p>On nearing the lakes, the atmosphere seemed saturated
with moisture, for no sooner had the sun gone down than
there was a heavy dew, which soaked our blankets and
clothes. We were at 16,550 feet in a narrow marshy creek
in which we had descended <i>&agrave; pic</i> from the last mountain
range. From the summit of the range we had seen many
columns of smoke rising from the neighbourhood of the
Rakas Lake, and we judged that again we must proceed
with great caution.</p>

<p>We cooked our food, and in the middle of the night, for
greater safety, we shifted our camp on the summit of the
plateau in a North-Easterly direction, and continued our
journey in the morning, high above the magnificent blue
sheet of the Devil's Lake with its pretty islands.</p>

<p>&quot;Sahib, do you see that island?&quot; exclaimed the Kutial,
pointing at a barren rock that emerged from the lake. &quot;On
it,&quot; he continued, &quot;lives a hermit Lama, a saintly man. He
has been there alone for many years, and he is held in
great veneration by the Tibetans. He exists almost entirely
on fish, and occasional swan's eggs, and only in winter,
when the lake is frozen, is communication established with
the shore, and supplies of <i>tsamba</i> are brought to him, for
they have no boats in Rakastal, nor any way of constructing
rafts, owing to the absence of wood. The hermit sleeps
in a cave, but generally comes out in the open to pray to
Buddha.&quot; During the following night, when everything
was still, a slight breeze blowing from the North brought
to us, faint and indistinct, the broken howls of the hermit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_214" id="Pg_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
&quot;What is that?&quot; I asked of the Shokas.</p>

<p>&quot;It is the hermit speaking to God. Every night he climbs
to the summit of the rock, and from there addresses his
prayers to Buddha the Great.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;How is he clothed?&quot; I inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;In skins.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<p>Late in the afternoon we had an amusing incident. We
came to a creek in which were a number of men and women,
hundreds of yaks and sheep, and some thirty ponies.</p>

<p>The Shokas became alarmed, and immediately pronounced
the folks to be brigands. I maintained that they were not,
and as Kachi expounded the theory that the only way to
distinguish Dakus from honest beings was to hear them talk
(the Dakus he declared usually shout at the top of their
voices when conversing, and use language far from select,
while well-to-do Tibetans speak gently and with refinement),
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_215" id="Pg_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
I thought the only thing to do was to go and address
the people, when by the tone of voice we should find out
what they were. This, however, did not suit my Shokas,
and we were placed in rather a curious position, for to
proceed we must either pass by the Tibetan encampment,
or we must march southwards round a mountain, which
would involve considerable trouble, fatigue, and waste of
time. We waited till night came, watching, unseen, the
Tibetans below us. As is customary with them, they retired
at sundown to their tents. Leaving my men behind, I
crawled into their camp during the night and peeped into
one of the tents. The men were squatting on the ground,
round a fire in the centre, upon which steamed two vessels
with stewing tea. One old man, with strongly-marked
Mongolian features, accentuated by the heavy shadows
which were cast by the light of the fire above his angular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_216" id="Pg_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
cheek-bones and prominent and wrinkled brow, was busily
revolving his prayer-wheel from left to right, repeating in a
mechanical way the usual <i>Omne mani padme hun</i>, words
which come from the Sanscrit, and refer to the reincarnation
of Buddha from a lotus flower, meaning literally, &quot;O God,
the gem emerging from a lotus flower.&quot; Two or three
other men, whose faces I could not well see, as they were
stooping very low, were busy counting money and examining
several articles of Indian manufacture, which undoubtedly
had been seized from Shokas. It was fortunate that they
had no dogs in this camp, for I, having discovered our
best way to pass them unperceived, went back to my men
and led them, in the middle of the night, through the camp
itself. We proceeded for a mile or so beyond the encampment,
and having selected a well-sheltered spot where we
could rest without fear of discovery, we laid down our loads
and tried to get a few hours' sleep. Waking at sunrise we
were startled to find ourselves surrounded by a band of
dacoits. They were our friends of the previous night,
who, having followed our tracks, and mistaking us for
Shoka traders, had now come for a little festive looting.
On drawing near they were given a somewhat warm
reception, and their instant retreat was more speedy than
dignified.</p>

<h5>Spied and followed by robbers&mdash;Jogpas' hospitality&mdash;Hares&mdash;Tibetan
charms resisted&mdash;Attempt to snatch Chanden Sing's
rifle out of his hands&mdash;The ridge between Rakas and Mansarowar
Lakes.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> wended our way along a narrow valley towards the
shore of the Devil's Lake, halting to cook our food about
half a mile from the water's edge, and I took this opportunity
to make observations for longitude. Also altitude
with hypsometrical apparatus. Water boiled at 185&deg; with
temperature of atmosphere at 64&deg;.</p>

<p>I had just repacked my instruments, and was lying flat in
the sun, some distance away from my men, when I thought
I saw something move. Jumping up, I beheld a stalwart
Tibetan stealing along the ground only a few yards
away from me, with the object no doubt of taking
possession of my rifle before I had time to discover
him. Unfortunately for him, he was not quick enough,
and all that he gained for his attempt was a good
pounding with the butt of my Mannlicher. He was one
of the Dakus we had seen in the morning, and no doubt
they had followed and spied upon us all along. Having got
over his first surprise, the dacoit, with an amusing air of
assumed innocence, requested us to go and spend the
night in his tent with him and his mates. They would
treat us right royally, he said. Being, however, well
acquainted with the hospitality of dacoits, we declined the
invitation. The brigand went away somewhat shaken and
disappointed, and we continued our journey along the water-edge
of the Devil's Lake (Rakas-tal), where hundreds of
hares sprang from under our feet, several of which I killed
with my rifle, using bullet cartridges. There were signs
all along that at some previous epoch the level of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_218" id="Pg_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
the lake must have been much higher than it is at
present.</p>

<p>Marching during the day we encountered many Tibetans,
some of whom were Dogpas, others Jogpas. When they saw
us approaching they generally bolted, driving their sheep
or yaks in front of them. Nevertheless, we came upon two
Tibetan women, very dirty, and their faces smeared with
black ointment to prevent the skin from cracking in the
high wind. They were dressed in long sheepskin garments,
worn out and filthy, and their coiffures were so unwashed
that they emitted a sickening odour. I ordered them not
to come too near us, for although these females had
no claims whatever to beauty&mdash;and, as far as I could see
they possessed no other charm&mdash;one being old and toothless,
the other with a skin like a lizard, they actually tried
to decoy us to their tents, possibly with the object of
getting us robbed by their men. My men seemed little
attracted by the comical speeches and gestures with which
they sought to beguile us, and I pushed on so as to be rid
of this uncanny pack as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Four Tibetans, who attempted to snatch Chanden Sing's
rifle out of his hand, received from him a battering that
they were unlikely soon to forget, and after this we were
fortunately left alone for the remainder of the day. In
the evening, Chanden Sing fired at a black wolf which
came close to camp, and I discovered, about one hundred
feet above lake-level, imbedded in the mountain side, a
stratum of gigantic fossils, which, owing to their size and
weight, I regretted to be unable to dig out and carry
away.</p>

<p>Feeling almost certain that we were being spied upon all
the time by the numerous Jogpas we had met, we attempted
to dodge them by pretending to encamp before sunset.
However, we only lighted a fine fire, and then after dark
escaped, walking and stumbling for several miles, until we
found a spot high on the hillside where we considered ourselves
safe. Snow fell heavily during the night, and, as
usual, we woke up with icicles hanging from our moustaches,
eyelashes and hair, notwithstanding which we really
were quite happy and well.</p>

<p>It was my good fortune to make quite sure from many
points that, as can be seen from the illustration reproduced
in these pages, the ridge between the Rakas and Mansarowar
Lakes is continuous, and no communication between the
two lakes exists. With the exception of a small depression
about half-way across, the ridge has an average height of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_219" id="Pg_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
1000 feet all along, a fact which ought in itself to dispose of the
theory that the two lakes are one. I also further ascertained from the
natives that there is no communication whatever between them, though the
depression in the ridge makes it probable that at a very remote period
some connection existed. The lowest point in this depression is over 300
feet above the level of the lake.</p>

<h5>More robbers&mdash;The friends of Tibetan authorities&mdash;A snap-shot&mdash;A
meek lot&mdash;Prepossessing female and her curious ways&mdash;The
purchase of two yaks.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> before leaving the shores of the Rakstal I had a great
slice of luck. It happened thus. We had been detected
by another band of dacoits who were trying their hardest
to overtake us. I had been spying them with my telescope
as they rode in our direction. They were driving
some twenty yaks in front of them at an unusually fast
pace. The dacoits rode ponies. We were about a mile
and a half ahead of them now, and close to the edge of
the Devil's Lake. We saw them coming down the hillside
at a breakneck speed straight in our direction. It was
evident that they were after us. My men became terror-stricken
when I gave the order to halt.</p>

<p>The band of dacoits approached and left the yaks in
charge of two women. When they galloped in a line
towards us, my men, with the exception of Chanden Sing
and Mansing, were paralysed with fright.</p>

<p>They were now a hundred yards off. With loaded rifle
in one hand, and my camera in the other, I advanced to
meet them, knowing that, with their old-fashioned matchlocks,
it takes them a considerable time to light the fuse and
fire a shot. Moreover, it is almost an impossibility for
them to fire on horseback, their weapons being heavy and
cumbersome.</p>

<p>I focused them in my twin lens photographic apparatus,
and waited till I had them well in the field. I snapped the
shot when they were only thirty yards away, vaulting over
their ponies in the act of dismounting. The camera, having
done its work, was quickly deposited on the ground, and the
rifle shouldered. I shouted to them to put down their</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_222" id="Pg_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
weapons, and to give force to my request I aimed at them
with my Mannlicher.</p>

<p>A meeker lot of brigands I do not believe could be
found, though people of that kind are often brave when
it is easy for them to be courageous. Their matchlocks
were unslung from their shoulders with remarkable
quickness and flung to the ground, and their
jewelled swords were laid by the side of their firearms.
They went down on their knees, and taking off their
caps with both hands, put out their tongues in sign of
salute and submission, and I could not help taking another
snap-shot at them in that attitude, which was comical, to
say the least of it.</p>

<p>My bearer, who had been left to look after the baggage,
had placed Mansing in charge, and was now by my side
with the Martini-Henry, when one of the women, riding
astride, arrived on the scene. She was evidently furious at
the cowardice of her men, and I liked her for that. She
jumped off her steed, ejaculated words at the top of her
voice, shaking her fists at the men still kneeling before me,
and at last, foaming with rage, spat on them. While thus
haranguing the band of highwaymen, she had an annoying
way of pointing at my baggage, but her speech seemed to
have little effect on the submissive crowd.</p>

<p>I, therefore, went up to her, patted her on the back, and
gave her a rupee to hold her tongue. She grabbed the coin
and rubbed it on her skin coat to make the silver shine.
She instantly became calm, and rubbing the coin until it was
quite bright, she raised her fiery eyes, staring into mine, and
pulled out her tongue to express her thanks.</p>

<p>Kachi and Dola, who knew Tibetan well, were now summoned
to address the filibusters for me, and these two
Shokas were in such trepidation that they could hardly
walk, much less speak. After a while, however, seeing how
well I had these supposed terrific rangers under control,
they were at last able to translate.</p>

<p>&quot;I want them to sell me some yaks and some ponies,&quot;
I said. &quot;I will pay handsomely for them.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They say they cannot. The Tarjum will cut their
heads off if he comes to know it. They will only sell one
or two yaks.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Very good. How much do they want?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Two hundred silver rupees. But,&quot; added Dola, &quot;sahib,
do not give them more than forty. That is a great deal
more than they are worth. A good yak costs from ten to
sixteen rupees.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_223" id="Pg_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
After some three or four hours' bargaining, during which time the bandits
descended gradually from two hundred rupees to forty and I rose from
twenty to that figure, we at last agreed, amidst the greatest excitement
on both sides, that their two best yaks should become my property. I
then, becoming quite friendly, purchased pack-saddles from them, and
sundry other curiosities. They gave me tea even and <i>tsamba</i>. The fiery
woman only had still a peculiar way of keeping her eyes fixed on my
baggage, and her longing for my property seemed to increase when she saw
me paying for the yaks. If she kept one eye on my goods, I kept both
there; and I took good care that my rifle was never out of my hand, and
that no one ever came too near me from behind.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Pack-saddles for Yaks</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>We counted the money down, some fifty rupees, including
all purchases. Each coin was passed round and sounded
by each of our sellers, and when the entire sum was handed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_224" id="Pg_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
over the coins were passed back and recounted so that there
should be no mistake. Time in Tibet is not money, and
my readers must not be surprised when I tell them that
counting, recounting and sounding the small amount took
two more hours. The two yaks were eventually handed
over to us. One, a huge long-haired black animal, restless
and powerful; the other equally black, strong and hairy,
but somewhat gentler.</p>

<p>To catch them, separate them from the herd, pass ropes
through their respective nostrils, and tie pack-saddles on
their backs, were all operations we as novices had to
master. It was hard work indeed, but we struggled till we
succeeded.</p>

<p>When we parted we were good friends, the bandits
behaving admirably, and I made up my mind that I would
at any time rather trust a bandit in Tibet than an official.</p>

<h5>Tibetan coats, hats, and boots&mdash;Why a Tibetan prefers
to leave half the chest and one arm bare&mdash;Ornamentations&mdash;Manner
and speech&mdash;Ignorance and superstition&mdash;Way
of eating&mdash;Jogpa women and children&mdash;Head-dress.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> a way, I was sorry when my interview with the
Jogpas came to an end, for, although they were undoubtedly
brigands, they were certainly interesting. Their original
and curious dress and manner of conversation, their
unusual but eminently suitable mode of eating, and
their jovial freedom of demeanour, were really quite
refreshing. Their dress was quite representative of Tibet,
for the men wore a great variety of coats and hats, probably
owing to the facility with which they obtained them, and
no two individuals were dressed alike, though certain
leading characteristics of dress were conserved in each case.
One man wore a gaudy coat trimmed with leopard skin,
another had a long grey woollen robe like a dressing-gown,
taken up at the waist by a kamarband, and a third was
garbed in a loose raiment of sheepskin, with the wool
inside. Yet a fourth was arrayed in a deep red tunic
fastened by a belt of leather with silver ornamentations
inlaid in wrought-iron to hold a needle-case, tinder-pouch
and steel, with a bead hanging from the leather thong, and a
pretty dagger with sheath of ebony, steel, and filigree silver,
besides other articles, such as a bullet-pouch and bag. In
their kamarbands or belts, the Jogpas, in common with the
majority of Tibetan men, wear a sword in front, and whether
the coat is long or short, it is invariably loose and made to
bulge at the waist in order that it may contain a store of
eating and drinking bowls, the &quot;<i>pu-kus</i>,&quot; snuff-box, and sundry
bags of money, and <i>tsamba</i> and bricks of tea! It is owing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_226" id="Pg_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
to this custom that most Tibetan men, when seen at first, impress one as
being very stout, whereas, as a matter of fact, they are somewhat slight
in figure. Tibetans leave one arm and part of the chest bare, letting the
sleeve hang loose. The reason for this practice, which seems to have
puzzled many people, is that in Tibet the days are very hot and the
nights cold (the drop in the thermometer in S.W. Tibet being at times as
much as 80&deg; and even 100&deg;), and as the Tibetans always sleep in
their clothes, the garments that protect their bodies from being frozen
at night are found too heavy and warm in the hot sun, and therefore this
simple expedient is adopted. When sitting down, both arms are drawn from
the sleeves and the chest and back are left bare; but when on foot, one
arm, usually the left, is slipped in, to prevent the coat and its heavy
contents from falling off.</p>

<p>I have no hesitation in pronouncing
the Tibetan boots, from a practical
point of view of utility, as the best in
the world. They have all the advantages
a boot should possess, especially those
with flat soles of thick twisted cord.
The upper part, being made of red and green felt, keeps the
foot warm without preventing ventilation, and plenty of
spreading room is left for the toes when walking. The felt
gaiter, reaching to just below the knee, holds the soft sole of
the boot flat under the foot, giving absolutely free action to
the ankle. The most salient and sensible point in the Tibetan
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_227" id="Pg_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>
footgear, however, is that the foot, all but the top part, is
encased in the thick sole, thus preventing the jamming of toes between
stones when walking, for instance, on <i>d&eacute;bris</i>, and also doing
away with the accumulation of snow and mud between the sole and boot, so
inconvenient in our footgear. There are many varieties and makes of boots
in Tibet, but the principle is always the same. The boots are always
homemade, each individual making his own, except in large towns, where
footgear can be purchased, and necessarily the quality is then not up to
the same high standard. The difference in Tibetan boots is mainly in the
quality or texture of the soles; for instance, the Lhassa boots have
finer, softer, and more elastic soles than those made in Sigatz (usually
written Shigatze), which are quite hard and stiff, and supposed to wear
out much sooner than the more pliable ones of the sacred city. Then there
are some with leather soles, made specially for wet or snowy regions, and
these when greased over are quite waterproof. Two kinds of these are in
use, one with pointed and curled toes for cutting one's way into the
snow, the other of the usual shape. Men and women alike wear these boots.
The principal Lamas and officials of Tibet have adopted the
Chinese-pattern boots of leather, with heavy leather or wooden soles and
enormous nails under them.</p>

<p>The Tibetans have innumerable varieties of headgear. The most peculiar of
all, worn chiefly by soldiers and dacoits, is one in the form of a
section of a cone with large rim, made entirely of twisted cord like that
used for the soles of the boots, and with a hole at the top for ventilation. The
conical part being too small to fit the head, it is held upon
the skull by means of two strings tied under the chin.
There are also conical brown and grey felt ones, not unlike
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_228" id="Pg_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>
filters used in chemical laboratories, and these, when
of the better quality, are frequently ornamented with
gold, blue, or red embroidery of Chinese manufacture.
An impressive headgear was worn by the medicine man
attached to the band of robbers I had interviewed. It
resembled at first sight an exaggerated jockey's cap of red
silk, but closer examination showed that it consisted of two
long strips of red silk, well stretched on a
light frame of bamboo, set at an angle of
about 90&deg;. This hat was held on the head
by means of a band round the back of the
head, and it projected some fifteen inches
over the forehead. In addition to these
there are of course common cloth or fur
caps with ear-flaps; and it is not uncommon to see, in Tibet,
soldiers wearing a silk kamarband bound tightly round the
head, turban-fashion, with one end left hanging down over
the ear. The commoner Tibetan, however, is not fond
of covering his head, and though he often has one or more
caps stowed away in the loose folds of his coat, he seldom
wears one on his head under ordinary circumstances. This
does not apply to officials, who are never seen without a
circular cap of Chinese shape, surmounted by a top-knot.
All men, except the Lamas, who shave their heads clean,
wear a pigtail, short and shaggy at times, or long and
ornamented with a piece of cloth, in which it is sewn, and
passed through rings of ivory, bone, glass, metal, or coral.
Ornaments of silver, such as perforated coins, are much
used in adorning the men's pigtails, and coral and malachite
ornaments are also common in Tibet for the same purpose,
and are much valued by the natives. Men wear,
passed through the lobe of the ear, an earring with malachite
ornamentations, and often with an additional long pendant.</p>

Hat, as Worn by Officials</div>
<p>It is usually of brass or silver, and occasionally of gold.
More common than the solitary earring is the brass or
silver charm-box, frequently containing a likeness of
Buddha, which nearly every Tibetan carries slung round
his neck. Tibetans are, as a rule, excessively superstitious
and fond of charms of every sort. Their superstitions are,
of course, the result of ignorance, and so are most of their
other bad qualities. Except among the higher officials and
the Lamas, education can hardly be said to exist in Tibet,
the population being kept in the most obscure ignorance.
Few can read, and none can write, and the Lamas take very
good care that only those shall learn who are likely to be of
use. Honesty and honour are two qualities almost
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_229" id="Pg_229"></a>[<a href="./images/229.png">229</a>]</span>
unknown in any class or condition in Tibet, and as for
truthfulness, all travellers in the country can testify to
the practical impossibility of obtaining it from a Tibetan.
Cruelty is innate in them, and vice and crime are everywhere
rampant.</p></div>

<p>That the Jogpas had good digestions was evident from the
way they ate when, having concluded the sale of the yaks,
they squatted down to a hearty meal of <i>tsamba</i>, <i>chura</i>, and
tea. They took from their coats their wooden and metal
<i>pu-kus</i>, and quickly filled them with <i>tsamba</i>; pouring over
it some steaming tea made as usual with butter and salt
in a churn, they stirred it round and round the bowl with
their dirty fingers until a paste was formed, which they
rolled into a ball and ate, the same operation being
repeated over and over again until their appetite was
satisfied. Each time, before refilling, the bowl was licked
clean by rotating the <i>pu-ku</i> round and round the tongue.
Feeling the heat of the sun, after their meal both men
and women removed their garments above the waist,
showing ornaments of gold, silver and copper encircling
their necks.</p>

<p>The women-folk of the dacoits, though far from beautiful,
possessed a certain charm, arising from their curious wildness.
Unlike those of the generality of Tibetan women,
their teeth were very good, and their complexion was not
specially dark, the black ointment with which their cheeks,
noses, and foreheads were smeared making them appear
darker than they really were, and being decidedly unbecoming.
All of them had regular features, and their eyes
and mouths were full of expression. Their hair had been
plaited into numberless little tresses, brought up and
fastened in a graceful curve over the head, kept firm by a
red turban, which was arranged to show another row of
little tresses on the forehead, the ends being joined in
succession to one another. They wore large earrings of
gold inlaid with malachite, and were in manner so unaffected
that they disregarded even the most primitive
conventions.</p>

<p>The children were talkative, and had the bearing of
adults. They wore swords in their belts, even at the early
age of eight or ten years. In a basket that had been
carried by one of the yaks I saw an infant only a few
months old. I caressed it, to the horror of his superstitious
mother, who snatched the child away and washed
and rubbed the poor little fellow's face until the skin was sore,
declaring that children die who are touched by strangers.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_230" id="Pg_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
The men were just as bad in this, and when I purchased
some rice from them they would not let me handle it till it
had become my property. They objected each time that
I stretched out my arm to touch the bag of rice, and
showed me eventually a handful of rice at a considerable
distance, to let me judge of its quality. I had to purchase
only the handful at first. Having assured myself
that it was all right, I then purchased the remainder.</p>

<h5>A Daku's strange ideas&mdash;The ridge between the two lakes&mdash;Black
tents&mdash;Confronting the two lakes&mdash;A chain of high
peaks&mdash;Gombas&mdash;Change in the weather.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had marched on the same afternoon about half a
mile in the direction of Mansarowar, when we were overtaken
by one of the Dakus, whom we had left a short
time before. He rode towards us, apparently in a great
state of excitement. Having dismounted, he drew his sword
and began chasing one of my yaks. This seemed so strange
a proceeding that we were at a loss to understand his
intentions, but as he screamed to us that he meant no harm
we let him go on. He eventually overtook one recalcitrant
yak, and, after a struggle with the unfortunate beast, he
flung his arms round its neck and rested his head between
its horns. I was anything but pleased with these antics,
fearing that this effusion was only a dodge to cut the
beast's throat. Much to my astonishment, I found that
the young Jogpa had seized a tuft of the yak's hair with
his teeth and was trying to tear it off, while the unfortunate
beast was making desperate efforts to shake off its persecutor.
The hair eventually gave way, and with a mouthful
of it hanging from both sides of his tightly closed lips
the Jogpa now let go of the animal's head, and, brandishing
his sword, made a dash for its tail.</p>

<p>I seized the man by his pigtail, while he in his turn clung
to the tail of the frightened yak, which bolting, dragged us
after it at an unpleasant pace.</p>

<p>The Jogpa, in our mad flight, cut off a long lock of the
yak's silky hair, and having secured this, appeared to
be quite satisfied, let go and sheathed his sword. He concealed
the stolen locks in his coat, and then made profound
obeisances to us, putting out his tongue as usual and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_232" id="Pg_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
declaring that unless that precaution is taken when parting
with a beast, bad luck is sure to come to you. This
closed the incident: the Jogpa rode away perfectly happy,
and we continued our march across the stony plain until
we reached the ridge which extends across it and divides
the two sheets of water. We climbed up to the top, rising
to 16,450 feet, and to make certain that the ridge really
extended right across, I made an expedition about half-way
across, finding the northern part somewhat lower than the
southern, still rising several hundred feet above the level of
the lakes. This expedition incurred some loss of time, and
when night came we were still on the ridge.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>From our camping-ground we saw fifteen black tents on
the hillside, and to the E. on the lake shore there was a
large Gomba or Lamasery, with a temple and a number of
mud houses. I estimated the distance between ourselves
and the Gomba at only eight miles, a cheering fact, because
I hoped to get fresh provisions there to enable us to proceed
more rapidly on our journey. We were now quite out of
reach of the Gyanema sepoys, as well as of the Barca
Tarjum and the Taklakot Jong Pen, and if we could only
obtain a sufficient quantity of food during the night, and
proceed by the jungle early the next day, there would be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_233" id="Pg_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
little danger of our being overtaken. The Shokas were, of
course, again shaking with fright at the idea of entering a
Tibetan settlement, but I told them very firmly that we must
reach Tucker Gomba and village that night.</p>

<p>We had below us the two great lakes, and before I
left this magnificent panorama, I could not help taking a
last long look at the marvellous scene. The Devil's Lake,
with its broken, precipitous shores, its rocky islands and
outstretching peninsulas, was far more enchanting to me
than the sacred lake at its side, in which, according to
tradition, dwell Mahadeva (pronounced Mahadeve) and all
the other good gods. Although the water is equally blue
and limpid; although each lake has for background the
same magnificent Gangri chain, Mansarowar, the creation
of Brahma, from whom it takes its name, is not nearly
so weirdly fascinating as its neighbour. Mansarowar has
no ravines rising precipitously from its waters, in which
their vivid colouring would be reflected as in a mirror; it is
almost a perfect oval, without indentations. There is a
stony, slanting plain some two miles wide between the
water's edge and the hills surrounding it, except along
the ridge separating it from the Rakstal, where its shore is
slightly more rugged and precipitous.</p>

<p>Directly south of the lake is a chain of high peaks covered
with snow, from which several streams descend. From
where we stood we could see evident signs, as in the case
of the Rakstal, that the level of the lake must at one time
have been at least thirty feet higher than it is at present, and
the slanting bed of small rounded and smooth stones, which
extends from one-and-a-half to two miles beyond the water-line,
is evidence enough that the water must once have
been up to that point; I believe that it is still gradually
receding.</p>

<p>Round the lake there are several tumbling-down sheds in
charge of Lamas, but only one important Gomba (monastery)
and a temple are to be found&mdash;viz., at Tucker village.</p>

<p>I was told that a small Gomba and <i>serai</i> in charge of
Lamas stands to the N.W. of the lake, but I cannot vouch
for the accuracy of the statement, as I did not visit it myself,
and the information I received from Tibetans regarding its
position and importance was conflicting.</p>

<p>As the nature of the country suddenly altered between
the Devil's Lake and Mansarowar, so, too, the weather and the
temperature greatly changed. Over the Rakstal we invariably
saw a lovely blue sky, whereas over Mansarowar heavy black
clouds always lowered, and rain fell incessantly. From
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_234" id="Pg_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
time to time the wind blew off the rain for a few minutes,
and lovely effects of light played on the water, but fresh
clouds, with violent bursts of thunder, soon made the scene
again gloomy and depressing.</p>

<p>It was much warmer on the Mansarowar side of the
ridge than on the other, and, probably owing to dampness,
the air seemed quite thick to breathe, instead of being crisp
and light, as it was along the shores of the Devil's Lake.
Indeed, when I recall the Mansarowar, I cannot help
thinking that it is the home, not only of the gods, but also
of all the storms.</p>

<h5>The Langa Tsangpo&mdash;A terrific storm&mdash;Drenched to the skin&mdash;Heavy
marching&mdash;Against the gods&mdash;Difficulty in finding
the Lamasery and village&mdash;A bark!&mdash;Arrival at last&mdash;Gentle
tapping&mdash;Under a roof.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> descended some two miles to the plain, and crossed
a rapid delta of the Langa Tsangpo or Langa River; then
another, a mile farther. As these rivers came directly from
the snows, the water was very cold, and often three or four
feet deep, owing to the thawing of the snow and ice during
the day.</p>

<p>No sooner had we reached the shores of the Mansarowar,
than the heavy clouds which had been hanging over our
heads poured forth such a torrent of rain, that in a moment
we were drenched to the skin. We were marching very
fast, as all our heavy loads were now on the two yaks, but
night was well advanced, and the darkness was such that
we could only see a few inches in front of us. We were
actually walking in an inch or two of water, and a fierce
S.E. wind drove the rain and hail so hard into our faces and
hands as to cause us considerable pain. We were frozen
in our wet garments, and our teeth were chattering, though
we walked quickly, keeping close together. From time to
time a bright flash of lightning shone on the lake, followed
by a terrific crash of thunder, and by what we could see
during those few seconds of light we tried to steer our way
towards Tucker village and Gomba.</p>

<p>The rivers, swollen by the rain, were extremely difficult
to cross, and the water seemed to flow so rapidly on the
inclined bed, that it was all we could do to keep on our
feet. So wet were we that we did not even take the trouble
to remove our shoes or garments, and we splashed through,
clothes and all. Three times we went into the freezing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_236" id="Pg_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
water above our waists, and then we marched for apparently
endless miles on the pebbly and stony incline. We could
not see where we were going, and the storm seemed to
grow worse every moment: we stumbled on amidst large
stones and boulders, and fell over one another on slippery
rocks. Farther on, we sank up to our knees in mud, and
each time that we lifted a foot it seemed to be of lead.
It was a downpour such as I had seldom before experienced.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you quite sure, Kachi, that this lake is the home of
the gods?&quot; I inquired of Kachi. &quot;Why, even on the
Devil's Lake we had better weather than this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied Kachi. &quot;But you make the gods
angry, and that is why they send thunder, hail and rain to
stop your progress. You are going on against the gods,
sir.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Never mind, Kachi. It cannot pour for ever.&quot;</p>

<p>At midnight we had no idea of our position, still we
pushed on.</p>

<p>&quot;Have we passed the Gomba? Have we not yet reached
it?&quot; were the questions we asked each other. It seemed
to me that, at the rate we were going, we ought by now to
be very near the place, and yet after another hour's tramp
we had not struck it. I was under the belief that we had
gone about nine miles, and I expressed the opinion that we
had passed it, but the Shokas insisted that we had not, so
we again proceeded.</p>

<p>We had hardly gone five hundred yards, when we heard a
faint, distant, and most welcome dog's bark. It came from
the N.W., and we surmised that it must come from Tucker.
We had steered too far south of the place, which accounted
for our missing it in the darkness.</p>

<p>Guided by the yelping, we hastily directed our steps
towards the settlements. The dog's solitary howl was at
once supplemented by fifty more angry barks, and though we
knew by the sound that we were approaching the village, it
was so dark and stormy that we could not find the place.
Only when we found ourselves close to the mud huts could
we be certain that we had at last arrived.</p>

<p>It was now between 2 and 3 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> The rain still came down
in torrents, and, alas! there was no sign of any of the
inhabitants being willing to give us shelter. It was quite
out of the question to pitch our little <i>tente d'abri</i>, for our
things were already wringing wet.</p>

<p>The noise we made tapping outside a door was determined,
so much so that the door itself nearly gave way.</p>

This was a shelter-house, a <i>serai</i> for pilgrims, and as
we claimed to be pilgrims, we had, by the laws of the
country, a right to admission. The Kutial Nattoo, who had
once before reached this lake by a different route, led us to
this house.</p>

<p>&quot;You are dacoits,&quot; said a hoarse voice from inside; &quot;or
you would not come at this hour.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, we are not,&quot; we entreated. &quot;Please open. We are
well-to-do people. We will harm no one, and pay for all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Middu, Middu!</i>&quot; (&quot;Cannot be, no.&quot;) &quot;You are dacoits.
I will not open.&quot;</p>

<p>To show that we were not what they imagined, faithful
Chanden Sing and Dola tapped again so gently at the door
that the bolt gave way. The next moment ten strangers
were squatting down round a warm fire drying their
shrivelled-up, soaked skins by the flame of dried tamarisk
and dung. The landlord, a doctor by the way, was reassured
when he saw that we had no evil intentions, and
found some silver coins in the palm of his hand. Yet he
said he would rather that we slept somewhere else: there
was a capital empty hut next door.</p>

<p>On our agreeing to this, he conducted us to the place,
and there we spent the remainder of the night, or rather the
early morning.</p>

<h5>The interior of a <i>serai</i>&mdash;Vermin&mdash;Fish, local jewellery, and
pottery for sale&mdash;Favourite shapes and patterns&mdash;How pottery
is made.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> abode was a one-storeyed house built of stones and mud with a flat
roof. There were two rooms, the first lighted by the door, the second and
larger having a square aperture in the ceiling for the triple purpose of
ventilation, lighting and outlet for the smoke of the fire, which burnt
directly underneath in the centre of the room. The beams and rafters
supporting the roof had been brought over from the other side of the
Himahlyas, as no wood is to be found in Western Tibet.</p>

<p>This <i>serai</i> was in charge of a young, half-demented lama, who was most
profuse in salutations, and who remained open-mouthed, gazing at us for a
considerable time. He was polite and attentive in helping to dry our
things in the morning, and, whenever we asked for anything, he ran out of
the <i>serai</i> in frantic fits of merriment, always bringing in what we
required.</p>

<p>The heavy storm during the night had flooded our room,
and there was only one corner slightly drier than the rest of
the floor, where we all slept huddled together. These <i>serais</i>
have no claim to cleanliness, and on this occasion all
the minor animal life that inhabited the floor had, with a
view to avoiding the water, retreated to the higher portion
of the room, which we also had selected, so that one more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_240" id="Pg_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>
trial was added to all our other miseries, for we were half devoured by a
variety of &quot;insects.&quot; This, indeed, was a dreadful pest, and
one from which we suffered indescribable agonies, not only on this
occasion but whenever we halted near Tibetan camps. When we rose in the
morning the room was full of Tibetan men, women and children, who seemed
very good-natured and friendly.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Tanga chick!</i>&quot; (a silver coin equivalent to half a rupee)
cried an old woman, who stuck a dried fish under my nose, professing
volubly that it had been caught in Mansarowar, and that it would make its
possessor the happiest of mortals. Others unrolled, from pieces of red
cloth, jewellery in the form of brooches, rings, and earrings of brass or
silver inlaid with malachite.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gurmoh sum!</i>&quot; (three rupees), &quot;<i>Diu, diu, diu</i>&quot; (&quot;Yes
yes, yes&quot;), &quot;<i>Karuga ni!</i>&quot; (two two-anna
pieces), &quot;<i>Gientcheke!</i>&quot; (a four-anna piece),
and so on, all talking at the same time,
in their anxiety to dispose of their goods.</p>

<p>The jewellery was of local manufacture, and in some cases the pieces of
malachite were firmly set, but usually a kind of paste is used for
holding the stones, and consequently, pretty as the jewels are, they soon
break.</p></div>

<p>The earrings are usually better made
than the brooches, but the most interesting of all, because
simpler and more characteristic, are the flat silver charms,
such as the one I give in the illustration, ornamented with a
primitive design. This particular one, which is now in my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_241" id="Pg_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
possession is of great antiquity, the edges being much worn
down. It has the lotus pattern in the centre and leaf
ornamentations filled in with lines radiating from a parent
stem. Concentric circles occupy the inner square, which
also contains circular dots in sets of threes and contiguous
semicircles. Triangles filled in with parallel lines are a
favourite form of ornamentation in Tibetan work, and, perhaps,
most popular of all in the mind of the Tibetan artist
is the square or the lozenge outline, with a special inclination
towards purely geometrical patterns, a tradition probably
inherited from their Mongol ancestors.</p>

<p>The most interesting objects to me at Tucker were the
specimens of pottery made by the natives, which is manufactured
from clay of fine quality, although it is not properly
beaten previous to being worked into vases, jugs, &amp;c.
Moulds are used to fashion the bases of the larger vessels
and the inner part is shaped by the hand; a rough turning-machine
simplifies the finishing of the upper part of the
vase, leaving it comparatively smooth. Two handles with
rough line ornamentations are added to the larger vessels, but
one suffices for the jars with longer neck and small aperture.</p>

<p>The two patterns reproduced in the illustration are those
more commonly adopted; the colour is a light greyish
terra-cotta, left fairly smooth and unvarnished. They are
well burnt, in primitive furnaces, the Lamas showing much
skill in the manufacture of these vessels, which find a ready
market among the pilgrims to the sacred lake. The tools
used in fashioning the vessels are extremely simple; a piece
of flat stone, and two or three wands of wood, beyond
which the Tucker potter does not really require more than
his fingers and his nails to accomplish his work.</p>

<h5>Friendly Lamas&mdash;Chanden Sing and Mansing purified&mdash;Mansing's
sarcasm&mdash;Pilgrims to Mansarowar and their privileges&mdash;For
luck!&mdash;Outside the Gomba.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Several</span> Lamas came to visit me in the morning, and
professed to be pleased to see us; in fact they asked me to
go and pay them a visit in the Lamasery and temple. They
said there was much sickness in the village, and as they
believed me to be a Hindoo doctor, they wished I could do
something to relieve their sufferings. I promised to do all
I could, and was very glad to have this unique chance of
visiting a Lamasery, and of studying the cases that would
be brought before me. I carried my rifle in my hand even
during this friendly visit to the Lamas.</p>

<p>When I came out of our stuffy, dark room, preceded and
followed by a crowd of inquisitive natives, I had a good look
round this strange village. After the storm of the night, we
did not have the beautiful blue sky that might have been
expected, but over us hung threatening clouds, while the
waters of the sacred lake, softly moved by the wind, made a
gentle lapping sound on the beach. Chanden Sing and Mansing,
the two Hindoos, divested of all their clothing except a
<i>doti</i>, were squatting near the edge of the lake, having their
heads shaved clean by Bijesing the Johari. I must confess
that I was somewhat annoyed when I saw them using my
best razor for the purpose, but I repressed my anger on
remembering that, according to their religion, the fact of
being at Mansarowar absolved them from all sins. My
two servants, with heads turned towards Kelas Mount,
seemed excited, and were praying so fervently that I stood
to watch them. They washed themselves repeatedly in
the water of the lake, and at last plunged into it. On
coming out shivering, they each took out of their
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_243" id="Pg_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
clothes a silver rupee, and flung it into the lake as an
offering to the God Mahadeva. Then, with hairless faces
and heads, they dressed and came to pay their salaams to
me, professing to be now happy and pure.</p>

<p>&quot;Siva, the greatest of all gods, lives in the waters of
Mansarowar,&quot; exclaimed my bearer in a poetic mood. &quot;I
have bathed in its waters, and of its waters I have drunk.
I have salaamed the great Kelas, the sight of which
alone can absolve all sins of humanity; I shall now go to
heaven.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall be satisfied if we get as far as Lhassa,&quot; grumbled
the sceptical Mansing, out of ear-reach of the Tibetans.</p>

<p>Chanden Sing, who was well versed in religious matters,
explained that only Hindoo pilgrims who had lost both
parents shaved their heads on visiting Mansarowar, as a
sacrifice to Siva, and if they were of a high caste, on their
return to their native land after the pilgrimage, it was
customary to entertain all the Brahmins of the town to a
banquet. A man who had bathed in Mansarowar was held
in great respect by everybody, and commanded the admiration
and envy of the entire world.</p>

<p>The Mansarowar Lake is about forty-six miles round, and
those pilgrims who wish to attain a greater state of sanctity
make a <i>kora</i> or circuit on foot, along the water-line. The
journey occupies from four to seven days, according to circumstances,
and one trip round will absolve the pilgrim from
ordinary sins; twice the circuit clears the conscience of any
murder; and three times will make honest and good a person
who has killed his or her father, mother, brother or sister.
There are fanatics who make the tour on their knees, others
accomplish the distance lying down flat at each step on their
faces like the pilgrims to Kelas.</p>

<p>According to legend, Mansarowar was created by Brahma,
and he who shall bathe in its waters will share the paradise
of Mahadeva! No matter what crimes he may have
previously committed, a dip in the holy lake is sufficient to
purge the soul as well as the body! To please my men,
therefore, and perhaps bring myself some luck, I too hurled
a couple of coins into the water.</p>

<p>The purifying ablutions being over, I ordered Chanden
Sing to take his rifle and follow me into the Gomba, as
the Lamas were so polite that I feared treachery on their
part.</p>

<p>The large square building, with its walls painted red and
its flattish dome of gilt copper, rose by the water-side, and
was both picturesque and handsome in its severe simplicity.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_244" id="Pg_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
There came sounds from inside of deep, hoarse voices
muttering prayers, the tinkling of bells and clanging of
cymbals. From time to time a drum was beaten, giving a
hollow sound, and an occasional and sudden touch upon a
gong caused the air to vibrate until the notes in a gradual
diminuendo were carried away over the holy lake.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI"></a>CHAPTER XLVI</h2>

<h5>Entering the Lamasery&mdash;The Lama's dwelling&mdash;Novices&mdash;Were
we in a trap?&mdash;Images&mdash;Oblations&mdash;Urghin&mdash;The holy
water, the veil of friendship, and absolution&mdash;Musical instruments,
books, &amp;c.&mdash;God and the Trinity&mdash;Heaven and hell&mdash;A
mystery.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> Chanden Sing and I had entered into the Lamasery,
the large door, which had been pushed wide open, was
immediately closed. We were in a spacious courtyard,
three sides of which had two tiers of galleries supported
by columns. This was the <i>Lhaprang</i>, or Lama's house, and
directly in front of me was the <i>Lha Kang</i>, or temple, the
floor of which was raised some five feet above the level
of the ground, with a very large door leading into it.
At this entrance were, one on either side, recesses
in which, by the side of a big drum, squatted two Lamas
with books of prayers before them, a praying-wheel and
a rosary in their hands, the beads of which they shifted
after every prayer. At our appearance the monks ceased
their prayers and beat the drums in an excited manner.
From what I could judge, there was a commotion in the
Gomba. Lamas, old and young, rushed to and fro out
of their rooms, while a number of Chibbis or novices&mdash;boys
between the ages of twelve and twenty&mdash;lined the banisters
of the upper verandah with expressions of evident suspense
and curiosity depicted on their faces. No doubt the Lamas
had prepared a trap for us. I warned Chanden Sing to be
on the alert, and set him on guard at the entrance of the
temple, while I, depositing a few silver coins on the drum
of the Lama to my right, took off my shoes in sign of
respect and&mdash;much to the amazement of the monks&mdash;quietly
entered the house of worship. Partly astonished at the
sight of the silver, and more so at my want of caution,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_246" id="Pg_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>
the Lamas, of whom there was a good number in the courtyard,
remained motionless and mute. The high Lama, or
Father Superior of the monastery, at last came forward,
stooping low and placing one thumb above the other and
putting his tongue out to show his superlative approval
of my visit to the many images representing deities or
sanctified Buddhist heroes which were grouped along the
walls of the temple. The largest of these were about five
feet high, the others about three feet. Some were carved
out of wood, their drapery and ornaments being fairly
artistic in arrangement and execution, while others were
fashioned in gilt metal. There were a number in a sitting
posture and some standing erect; and they all rested on
ornamented pedestals or plainer bases painted blue, red,
white and yellow. Many wore the ancient Chinese double-winged
cap, as used to this day by Corean officials, and
were placed in recesses in the wall decorated with stuffs,
wood carvings, and rough paintings of images.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">Entrance to the Tucker Temple</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>At the foot of these images was a long shelf, on which, in
bright brass vessels of all sizes, were oblations of <i>tsamba</i>,
dried fruit, <i>chura</i>, wheat and rice offered through the Lamas
by the devotees to the different saints. Some of the ears
of barley were ornamented with imitation leaves of <i>murr</i>
(butter), coloured red, blue and yellow.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_247" id="Pg_247"></a>[<a href="./images/247.png">247</a>]</span>
The ceiling of the temple was draped in red woollen
cloth similar to that of the clothes worn by the Lamas themselves,
and from it hung hundreds of strips of silk, wool and
cotton of all imaginable colours. The roof was supported
by columns of wood forming a quadrangle in the centre
of the temple and joined by a balustrade, compelling the
worshippers to make a circuit from left to right in order
to pass before the several images. In a shrine in the
central part of the wall facing the entrance was <i>Urghin</i> or
<i>Kunjuk-chick</i>, &quot;God alone,&quot; and in front of it on a kind of
altar covered with a carpet a collection of donations far
more abundant than those offered to the other images.</p>

<p>The Lama, pointing at it, told me that it was a good God,
and so I salaamed it and deposited a small offering in
a handy collection-box, which seemed to please the Lama
greatly, for he at once fetched a holy water amphora, hung
with long veils of friendship and love, and poured some
scented liquid on the palms of my hands. Then, producing
a strip of veil, he wetted it with the scent and presented
it to me. The majority of pilgrims generally go round
the inside of the temple on their knees, but, notwithstanding
that, to avoid offending prejudices, I generally
follow the principle of doing in Rome as the Romans
do, I could not here afford the chance of placing myself
at such a disadvantage in case of a surprise. The high Lama
explained the different images and threw handfuls of rice
over them as he called them by their respective names, all
of which I tried hard to remember, but, alas! before I could
get back to the <i>serai</i> and scribble down their appellations,
they had all escaped my memory. A separate entrance led
from the living part of the monastery into the temple.</p>

<p>Lights, burning in brass bowls, their wicks being fed with
melted butter, were scattered on the floor in the central
quadrangle, and near them lay oblong books of prayers
printed on the smooth yellow Tibetan paper made from a
fibrous bark. Near these books were small drums and
cymbals. One double drum, I noticed, was made from
reversed sections of human skulls, and my attention was
also attracted by some peculiar headgear worn by the
Lamas during their services and ceremonies. On these
occasions they not only accompany their chanting and
prayers with the beating of drums and clashing of
cymbals, but they at the same time make a noise on cane
flutes, tinkle hand-bells, and sound a large gong. The
noise of these instruments is at times so great that the
prayers themselves are quite inaudible. Unfortunately,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_248" id="Pg_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>
I failed to see any of the awe-inspiring masks which are
used by Lamas in their eccentric and mystic dances,
during which, when the Lamas spend the whole day in
the temple, they consume much tea with butter and
salt in it, which is brought to them in cups by Lamas of
an inferior order, acting as servants. They pass hour
after hour in their temples apparently absolutely absorbed
in praying to the God above all gods, the incarnation of all
the saints together united in a trinity, the <i>Kunjuk-Sum</i>.</p>

<p><i>Kunjuk-Sum</i>, translated literally, means &quot;the three deities,&quot;
and some take it to refer to the elements, air, water and fire,
which in the Tibetan mind are symbols of speech, charity
and force and life. One great point in Buddhism, as everyone
knows, is the advocation of love and respect to one's
father and mother and the prohibition against injuring one's
neighbours in any way. According to the precepts contained
in some eight hundred volumes called the Kajars, the
Tibetans believe in a heaven (the Deva Tsembo) free from
all anxieties of human existence, full of love and joy, and ruled
over by a god of infinite goodness, helped by countless
disciples called the <i>Chanchubs</i>, who spend their existence
in performing charitable deeds among living creatures.
With a number of intermediate places of happiness and
punishment they even believe in a hell, where the souls of
sinners are tormented by fire and ice.</p>

<p>&quot;God sees and knows everything, and He is everywhere,&quot;
exclaimed the Lama, &quot;but we cannot see Him. Only the
<i>Chanchubs</i> can see and speak to Him.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What are the evil qualities to be mostly avoided?&quot; I
inquired of the high Lama, who spoke a little Hindustani.</p>

<p>&quot;Luxury, pride and envy,&quot; he replied.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you ever expect to become a saint?&quot; I asked him.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, I hope so, but it takes five hundred transmigrations
of an uncontaminated soul before one can be one.&quot;</p>

<p>Then, as if waking to a sudden thought, he seized my
hand impulsively and spread my fingers open. Having
done this, he muttered two or three words of surprise. His
face became serious, even solemn, and he treated me with
strange obsequiousness. Rushing out of the temple, he went
to inform the other Lamas of his discovery, whatever it was.
They crowded round him, and from their words and
gestures it was easy to see that they were bewildered.</p>

<p>When I left the company of the strange idols and came
into the courtyard, every Lama wished to examine and
touch my hand, and the sudden change in their behaviour
was to me a source of great curiosity, until I learnt the real
cause of it some weeks later.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> I left the monastery, the Lamas, who had now
become more or less accustomed to me, asked me many
questions regarding India and concerning medicine. These
seemed to be subjects of great interest to them. They also
questioned me as to whether I had heard that a young sahib
had crossed over the frontier with a large army, which the
Jong Pen of Taklakot had defeated, beheading the sahib
and the principal members of the expedition.</p>

<p>I professed to be ignorant of these facts, and so I really
was, though I naturally felt much amused at the casual way
in which the Jong Pen of Taklakot had disposed of the
bearskin before he had even caught the bear himself. The
Lamas took me for a Hindoo doctor, owing to the colour
of my face, which was sunburnt and had long remained
unwashed, and they thought that I was on a pilgrimage
of circumambulation round the Mansarowar Lake. They
appeared anxious to know whether illnesses were cured by
occult sciences in India, or by medicines only. I, who, on
the other hand, was more interested in getting information
than in giving it, turned the conversation on the Lamas
themselves.</p>

<p>Of course I knew that there are sects of red, yellow,
white and black Lamas, the red ones being the older and
more numerous throughout the country; next to them
come the yellow Lamas, the <i>Gelupkas</i>, equally powerful in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_250" id="Pg_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
political and religious matters, but not quite so numerous;
and, lastly, the white Lamas and the black Lamas, the
<i>Julinba</i>, who are the craftsmen in the monasteries, working
at painting, printing, pottery and ornamentation, besides
attending on the other Lamas and making themselves useful
all round in the capacities of cooks, shepherds, water-carriers,
writers, and last, but not least, executioners. The
lamaseries are usually very rich, for the Tibetans are a deeply
devout race, and the Lamas are not backward in learning
how to extort money from the ignorant worshippers
under pretences of all kinds. Besides attending to their
religious functions, the Lamas are traders at large, carrying
on a smart money-lending business, and charging a very
high interest, which falls due every month. If this should
remain unpaid, all the property of the borrower is confiscated,
and if this prove insufficient to repay the loan the
debtor himself becomes a slave to the monastery. It is
evident, from the well-fed countenances of the Lamas,
that, notwithstanding their occasional bodily privations,
they as a rule do not allow themselves to suffer in any
way, and no doubt can be entertained as to their leading
a smooth and comfortable existence of comparative luxury&mdash;a
condition which frequently degenerates into vice and
depravity.</p>

<p>The larger lamaseries receive a yearly Government
allowance, and considerable sums are collected from the
oblations of the faithful, while other moneys are obtained
by all sorts of devices which, in any country less religious
than Tibet, would be considered hardly honourable and
often even altogether criminal. To any one acquainted with
Tibet, it is a well-known fact that, except in the larger towns,
nearly all people besides brigands and Lamas are absolutely
poor, while the monks themselves and their agents live
and prosper on the fat of the land. The masses are maintained
in complete ignorance, and seldom is a layman found
who can write or even read. Thus everything has to go
through the Lamas' hands before it can be sanctioned.</p>

<p>The lamaseries and the Lamas, and the land and property
belonging to them, are absolutely free from all taxes and
dues, and each Lama or novice is supported for life by an
allowance of <i>tsamba</i>, bricks of tea, and salt. They are
recruited from all ranks, and whether honest folks or
murderers, thieves or swindlers, all are eagerly welcomed
on joining the brotherhood. One or two male members of
each family in Tibet take monastic orders, and by these
means the monks obtain a great hold over each house- or</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_252" id="Pg_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
tent-hold. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that in Tibet
half the male population are Lamas.</p>

<p>In each monastery are found Lamas, Chibbis, and a
lower grade of ignorant and depraved Lamas, slaves, as it
were, of the higher order. They dress, and have clean-shaven
heads like their superiors, and do all the handiwork
of the monastery; but they are mere servants, and take no
direct, active part in the politics of the Lama Government.
The Chibbis are novices. They enter the lamasery when
very young, and remain students for many years. They
are constantly under the teaching and supervision of the
older ones, and confession is practised from inferior to
superior. After undergoing, successfully, several examinations
they become effective Lamas, which word translated
means &quot;high priest.&quot; These Chibbis take minor parts in
the strange religious ceremonies in which the Lamas,
disguised in skins and ghastly masks, sing and dance
with extraordinary contortions to the accompaniment
of weird music made by bells, horns, flutes, cymbals and
drums.</p>

<p>Each large monastery has at its head a Grand Lama, not
to be confounded with the Dalai Lama of Lhassa, who is
believed, or rather supposed, to have an immortal soul
transmigrating successively from one body into another.</p>

<p>The Lamas eat, drink and sleep together in the monastery,
with the exception of the Grand Lama, who has a room to
himself. For one moon in every twelve they observe a
strict seclusion, which they devote to praying, and during
which time they are not allowed to speak. They fast for
twenty-four hours at a time, with only water and butter-tea,
eating on fast-days sufficient food only to remain alive,
and depriving themselves of everything else, including snuff
and spitting, the two most common habits among Tibetan
men.</p>

<p>The Lamas have great pretensions to infallibility, and on
account of this they claim, and obtain, the veneration of the
people, by whom they are supported, fed and clothed. I
found them, as a rule, very intelligent, but inhuman, barbarously
cruel and dishonourable, and this was not my own
experience alone: I heard the same from the overridden
natives, who wish for nothing better than a chance to shake
off their yoke.</p>

<p>Availing themselves of the absolute ignorance in which
they succeed in keeping the people, the Lamas practise
to a great extent occult arts, by which they profess to cure
illnesses, discover murders and thefts, stop rivers from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_253" id="Pg_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>
flowing, and bring storms about at a moment's notice.
Certain exorcisms, they say, drive away the evil spirits that
cause disease. It is certain that the Lamas are adepts at
hypnotic experiments, by which means they contrive to let
the subjects under their influence see many things and
objects that are not there in reality. To this power are due
the frequent reports of apparitions of Buddha, seen
generally by single individuals, and the visions of demons,
the accounts of which alone terrify the simple-minded folk,
and cause them to pay all their spare cash in donations to
the monastery.</p>

<p>Mesmerism plays an important part in their weird dances,
during which extraordinary contortions are performed, and
strange positions assumed, the body of the dancer being
eventually reduced to a cataleptic state, in which it remains
for a great length of time.</p>

<p>The Lamas swear to celibacy when they enter a lamasery;
but they do not always keep these vows, and they are
besides addicted to the most disgusting of all vices in its very
worst forms, which accounts for the repulsive appearance
of far-gone depravity so common among the middle-aged
Lamas.</p>

<p>All the larger lamaseries support one or more Lama
sculptors, who travel all over the district, and go to the
most inaccessible spots to carve on rocks, stones, or pieces
of horn, the everlasting inscription, &quot;<i>Omne mani padme
hun</i>,&quot; which one sees all over the country. Unseen, I once
succeeded, after much difficulty and discomfort, in carrying
away two of these very heavy inscribed stones, which are still
in my possession, and of which reproductions are here given.</p>

<p>Weird and picturesque places, such as the highest points
on mountain passes, gigantic boulders, rocks near the
sources of rivers, or any spot where a <i>mani</i> wall exists, are
the places most generally selected by these artists to engrave
the magic formula alluding to the reincarnation of Buddha
from a lotus flower.</p>

<p>The famous prayer-wheels, those mechanical contrivances
by which the Tibetans pray to their god by means of water,
wind and hand-power, are also manufactured by Lama
artists. The larger ones, moved by water, are constructed
by the side of, or over, a stream, and the huge cylinders
on which the entire Tibetan prayer-book is inscribed
are revolved by the flowing water. The wheels moved
by wind-power are similar to those used by the
Shokas, which I have already described, but the Tibetans
often have prayers printed on the slips of cloth. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_254" id="Pg_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
smaller prayer-wheels, revolved by hand, are of two
different kinds, and are made either of silver or copper.
Those for home use are cylinders, about six inches high.
Inside these revolve on pivots, on the principle of a spinning
top, the rolls of prayers which, by means of a projecting
knob above the machine, the worshipper sets in motion.
The prayers can be seen revolving inside through a square
opening in the cylinder. The more universal prayer-wheel
in everyday use in Tibet is, however, of the pattern
shown in the illustration. It is usually constructed of
copper, sometimes of brass, and frequently entirely or
partly of silver. The cylinder has two movable lids, between
which the prayer-roll fits tightly. A handle with an iron rod
is passed through the centre of the cylinder and roll, and is
kept in its place by means of a knob. A ring, encircling
the cylinder, attaches it to a short chain and weight; this
serves, when started by a jerk of the hand, to give a
rotatory movement, which must, according to rule, be from
left to right, and which is kept up indefinitely, the words
&quot;<i>Omne mani padme hun</i>,&quot; or simply &quot;<i>Mani, mani</i>,&quot; being
repeated all the time.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Stone with Inscription</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The more ancient wheels have the prayers written by hand
instead of printed, and are contained in a small black
bag. Charms, such as rings of malachite, jade, bone, or
silver, are often attached to the weight and chain by which
the rotary movement is given to the wheel. These praying-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_255" id="Pg_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>machines
are found in every Tibetan family, and nearly
every Lama possesses one. They keep them jealously, and
it is very difficult to get the real ones. I was particularly
fortunate, and during my journey in Tibet I was able to
purchase as many as twelve, two of which were extremely old.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Prayer-wheels&mdash;Ancient and Modern. Showing Rolls of Prayers to Go Inside</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Besides the rosary, which the Lamas always use in a
similar way to the Roman Catholics, they have a brass
instrument which they twist between the palms of their
hands while saying prayers, and this is used exclusively by
Lamas. It is from 2&frac12; to 3 inches in length, and is rounded
so as to be easily held in the hollow of the two hands.</p>

<p>In Tibet, as in other Buddhist countries, there are
nunneries besides lamaseries. The nuns, most unattractive
in themselves, shave their heads and practise witchcraft and
magic, just as the Lamas do. They are looked down upon
by the masses. In some of these nunneries strict <i>clausura</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_256" id="Pg_256"></a>[<a href="./images/256.png">256</a>]</span>
is enforced, but in most of them the Lamas are allowed free
access, with the usual result, that the nuns become the
concubines of the Lamas. Even apart from this, the
women of the nunneries are quite as immoral as their
brethren of the lamaseries, and at their best they are but a
low type of humanity.</p>

<p>The Lamas who, at certain periods of the year, are allowed
an unusual amount of freedom with women, are those who
practise the art of making musical instruments and eating-vessels
out of human bones. The skull is used for making
drinking-cups, <i>tsamba</i> bowls, and single and double drums,
and the humerus, femur, and tibia bones are turned into
trumpets and pipes. These particular Lamas are said to
relish human blood, which they drink out of the cups made
from men's skulls.</p>

<h5>Illnesses and remedies&mdash;Curious theories about fever&mdash;Evil
spirits&mdash;Blacksmith and dentist&mdash;Exorcisms&mdash;Surgical operations&mdash;Massage
and cupping&mdash;Incurable illnesses&mdash;Deformities&mdash;Deafness&mdash;Fits
and insanity&mdash;Melancholia&mdash;Suicides.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Lamas became quite communicative, enabling me,
partly with the little Hindustani that I knew and partly
with the Tibetan I had picked up, to enter into a conversation
about illnesses and their remedies, certain as I was that
they must have strange notions on the subject. I was not
disappointed in this surmise, and from that conversation
and my own observation on previous and subsequent occasions,
I am able to give a few details of the methods of the
Lamas in curing the more frequent ailments found in the
country.</p>

<p>The Lamas explained to me that all diseases arose from
fever, instead of fever being an accompaniment of most illnesses,
and furthermore, that fever itself was but an evil
spirit, which assumed different forms when it entered the
body, and caused all sorts of complaints. The fever demon,
they asserted, was a spirit, but there were yet other demons
who were so good as to bring us riches and happiness.
For instance, when a man after a dangerous illness visited a
a cave, waterfall or river-gorge which these demons were
supposed to haunt, he might have a relapse and die, or he
might be instantly cured and live happy ever afterwards. In
the latter case, as would naturally be expected, the recipient
of such inestimable privileges generally returned to pay a
second visit to the kindly spirits who made his life worth
living, &quot;but,&quot; said the Lamas quite seriously, &quot;when he goes
a second time he will get blind or paralytic, as a punishment
for his greediness.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The evil spirits,&quot; continued a fat old Lama with crooked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_258" id="Pg_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
fingers, which he clenched and shook as he spoke, &quot;are in
the shape of human beings or like goats, dogs, sheep or
ponies, and sometimes they assume the semblance of wild
animals, such as bears and snow leopards.&quot;</p>

<p>I told the Lamas that I had remarked many cases of go&icirc;tre
and also other abnormalities, such as hare-lip and webbed
fingers and toes, as well as the very frequent occurrence of
supernumerary fingers or toes. I asked them the reason
for such cases, and they attributed them, with the exception
of webbed fingers, to the mischievous work of demons
before the child's birth; they could not, however, suggest
a remedy for go&icirc;tre.</p>

<p>Inguinal and umbilical hernia are quite common, as I have
on several occasions observed, and coarse belts are made
according to the taste and ingenuity of the sufferer, but are
of hardly any efficacy in preventing the increase of the
swellings.</p>

<p>A common complaint, especially among the older women,
was rheumatism, from which they seemed to suffer considerably.
It affected their fingers and toes, and particularly the
wrists and ankles, the joints swelling so as to render them
quite stiff, the tendons contracting, swelling, and becoming
prominent and hard in the palms of the hands.</p>

<p>Both before and after my conversation with the Lamas I
had opportunities of ascertaining that the stomachs of the
Tibetans are seldom in good working order. But how
could they be when you consider the gallons of filthy tea
which they drink daily, and the liquor to which they are so
partial? This poisonous concoction is enough to destroy
the gastric juices of an ostrich! The tongue, as I have
mentioned already, is invariably thickly furred with a
whitish coating, and Tibetans have often complained to me
of tumours as well as of painful burnings in the stomach,
the latter undoubtedly caused by ulcerations. It is to be
regretted that, even in the high land of Tibet, the worst of
all sexual diseases (called by the Tibetans <i>Boru</i>) has made
vast numbers of victims, palpable traces of it showing themselves
in eruptions, particularly on the forehead and on the
ears, round the mouth and under the nostrils, on the arms
and legs. In cases of very long standing, a peculiar whitish
discoloration of the skin and gums was to be noticed, with
abnormal contraction of the pupils. That such a disease is
well rooted in the country we have proof enough in the foul
teeth which the majority of Tibetans possess. In nearly all
cases that I examined, the teeth were, even in young men,
so loose, decayed and broken as to make me feel quite sorry
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_259" id="Pg_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
for their owners, and during the whole time I was in Tibet&mdash;and
I came in contact with several thousand people&mdash;I
believe that I could almost count on my fingers the sets of
teeth that appeared quite regular, healthy and strong. As a
rule, too, the women had better teeth than the men. No
doubt the admixture of bad blood in the Tibetan race contributes
a great deal to the unevenness and malformation
of their teeth, and if we add to this the fact that the corruption
of the blood, even apart from disease, is very great
owing to their peculiar laws of marriage, it is not surprising
that the services of dentists are everywhere required.
The teeth of Tibetans are generally of such a brittle nature
that the dentist of Tibet&mdash;usually a Lama and a blacksmith
as well&mdash;has devised an ingenious way of protecting them
from further destruction by means of a silver cap encasing
the broken tooth. I once saw a man with all his front teeth
covered in this fashion, and as the dentist who had attended
to him had constructed the small cases apparently with no
regard to shape or comfort, but had made most of them
end in a point for mastication's sake, the poor man had a
ghastly appearance every time that he opened his mouth.
The Tibetans are not very sensitive to physical pain, as I
have had reason to judge on several occasions, when I
have seen teeth extracted in the most primitive fashion,
without a sound being emitted from the sufferer.</p>

<p>In South-Western Tibet the <i>Hunyas</i> (Tibetans) have the
same strange notions on transmigration of evil spirits that
are common to the Shokas. For instance, if a man falls ill,
they maintain that the only remedy is to drive away the evil
spirit which has entered his body. Now, according to Tibetan
and Shoka ideas, evil spirits always enter a living body to
satisfy their craving for blood: therefore, to please the
spirit and decoy him away, if the illness be slight, a small
animal such as a dog or a bird is brought and placed close
by the patient; if the illness be grave, a sheep is produced
and exorcisms are made in the following fashion. A bowl
of water is whirled three or four times over the sick man's
head, and then again over the animal selected, upon whose
head it is poured. These circles, described with certain
mystic words, have the power of drawing the spirit out of its
first quarters and causing it to enter the brain of the second
victim, upon whose skull the water is poured to prevent its
returning back.</p>

<p>&quot;Of course,&quot; said my informer with an air of great
gravity, &quot;if you can give the evil spirit a present in the
shape of a living being that will satisfy him, he will depart
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_260" id="Pg_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
quite happy.&quot; If the illness is slight, it means that the
spirit is not much out of temper, and a small present is
enough to satisfy him, but if the disease is serious, nothing
less than a sheep or even a yak will be sufficient. As soon
as the spirit has changed his temporary abode the animal
is quickly dragged away to a crossing of four roads, and if
there are no roads a cross is previously drawn on the ground,
where a grave for the animal is dug, into which it is mercilessly
thrown and buried alive. The spirit, unable to make
a rapid escape, remains to suck the blood of his last victim,
and in the meantime the sick man, deprived of the company
of his ethereal and unwelcome guest, has time to make a
speedy recovery. When a smaller animal is used, such as a
dog or a bird, and when the patient complains of more than
one ailment, the poor beast, having been conveyed to the
crossing of four roads, is suddenly seized and brutally torn
into four parts, which are flung in four different directions,
the idea being that, wherever there may be spirits waiting
for blood, they will get their share and depart happy. After
their craving is satisfied, the evil spirits are not very
particular whether the blood is human
or not. In Shoka land especially,
branches with thorns and small flying
prayers are placed on each road to
prevent their immediate return. These
are said to be insuperable barriers to
the evil spirits.</p>

Branch with Thorns to Prevent Return of Evil Spirits</div>
<p>When a patient completely recovers, the Lamas naturally obtain money for
the exorcisms which have expelled the illness, and they never fail to
impress upon the people the extraordinary powers they possess over the
much-dreaded demons.</p>

<p>The Tibetans are unsuccessful in
surgery, first of all because they do not
possess sufficient knowledge of human
anatomy; secondly, because their
fingers are wanting in suppleness and
sensitiveness of touch; and lastly, because
they are not able to manufacture instruments of sufficient
sharpness to perform surgical operations with speed
and cleanliness. In Tibet everybody is a surgeon, thus
woe to the unfortunate who needs one. It is true that
amputation is seldom performed; but if it should become
necessary, and the operation is at all difficult, the patient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_261" id="Pg_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>
generally succumbs. The Tibetan surgeon does not know
how to saw bones, and so merely severs the limb at the
place where the fracture has occurred. The operation is
performed with any knife or dagger that happens to be at
hand, and is, therefore, attended with much pain, and
frequently has disastrous results. The precaution is taken
to tie up the broken limb above the fracture, but it is
done in such a clumsy way that very often, owing to the
bad quality of Tibetan blood, mortification sets in, and, as
the Tibetans are at a loss what to do on such occasions,
another victim goes to join the majority.</p></div>

<p>Considering the nomadic habits of the Tibetans and the
rough life they lead, they are comparatively immune from
very bad accidents. Occasionally there is a broken arm or
leg which they manage to set roughly, if the fracture is not
a compound one, by putting the bones back in their right
position, and by tightly bandaging the limbs with rags,
pieces of cloth and rope. Splinters are used when wood is
obtainable. A powder made from a fungus growing on
oak-trees in the Himahlyas is imported and used by the
Tibetans near the frontier. A thick layer of it, when wet,
is rubbed and left upon the broken limb, over which the
bandaging is afterwards done. In a healthy person, a
simple fracture of the leg, which by chance has been
properly set, takes from twenty to thirty days to heal, after
which the patient can begin moving about; and a broken
arm does not require to be kept in a sling more than fifteen
or twenty days. If these cures are somewhat more rapid
than with our more civilised methods of bone-setting, it
is merely due to the wholesome climate and the fact
that the natives spend most of their days out in the open
air and in the sun, undoubtedly the best cure for any
complaint of that kind; but, of course, it is but seldom
that the bones are joined properly, and they generally
remain a deformity. More satisfactory results are obtained
with cases of dislocations by pulling the bones into their
right position.</p>

<p>In case of wounds the bleeding is arrested by the application
of a wet rag tightly bound over the wound. In most
cases of unbandaged wounds that came under my notice the
process of healing was a very slow one, the great changes
in the temperature between night and day often causing
them to open of themselves. They made good headway
towards recovery in the beginning, but the skin was very
slow in joining and re-forming.</p>

<p>Burns are treated by smearing butter over them; and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_262" id="Pg_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
poultice of rhubarb is used to send down swellings of contusions
as well as for the purpose of bringing boils, from
which the Tibetans suffer much, to a speedy maturation.</p>

<p>Aconite is given for fever and rheumatism, and a rough
kind of massage is used to allay pain in the muscles of
limbs. It is generally done by the women, who, as far
as I could judge, practised it with no real knowledge
but merely contented themselves with violent rubbing
and pinching and thumping until signs of relief appeared
on the sufferer's face. Whether, however, these manifestations
were due to actual soothing of pain, or to the
prospect of the masseuse bringing her treatment to an
end, I could never properly ascertain. Tibetan fingers are
not well adapted for such work, being clumsy and, compared
with those of other Asiatic races, quite stiff and
hard.</p>

<p>Cupping is adopted with success. Three or four small
incisions are made close to one another and a conical
cupping-horn about seven inches long, having a tiny
hole at its point, is applied over them. The operator then
sucks through this small aperture until the horn is full of
blood, when it is removed and the operation begun again.
With poisoned wounds the sucking is done by applying the
lips to the wound itself.</p>

<p>Bleeding is used as a remedy for bruises and swellings,
and for internal pain, also for acute attacks of rheumatism
and articular pains. If it is not sufficient, the branding cure
is resorted to, and if this should also fail, then the tinder
cones, to be described later on, come into play and, the seat
of the pain being encircled with them, they are set alight.
When even this remedy proves inefficacious, and the patient
survives it, the illness is pronounced incurable!</p>

<p>Natural abnormalities and deformities are frequent
enough in Tibet, and some came under my notice in
nearly every camp I entered. Deformities of the spine
were common, such as displacement of the shoulder-blades;
and I saw during my stay in Tibet many cases of actually
humpbacked people. There were frequent cases, too, of
crookedness of the legs, and clubfoot was not rare, while
one constantly met with webbed fingers and supernumerary
fingers and toes, as well as the absence of one or more
of them. Malformations of the skull, such as the two sides
being of marked unequal shape or an abnormal distance
between the eye sockets, were the two most common
deformities that came under my notice.</p>

<p>The ears of men of the better classes were much elongated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_263" id="Pg_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
artificially by the constant wearing of heavy earrings, which
sometimes even tore the lobe of the ear.</p>

<p>The most frequent and curious of all was the extreme
swelling of children's stomachs, caused by the umbilical
cord not being properly tied at birth. The operation was
generally performed by the mother and father of the
newly-born or by some friend at hand. The infants had
such enormous paunches that in some cases they were
hardly able to stand; but, as they grew older, the swelling
seemed to gradually abate and the body assumed its normal
shape.</p>

<p>Deafness was common, but I never came across any
dumb people, though I now and then encountered cases
of painful stammering and other defects of articulation
arising from malformation of the palate and tongue.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the difficulty of speech was caused
by dementia, which seemed very common in Tibet, especially
among the young men. Whether it was caused by
cardiac affection subsequent to organic vices, as I suspected,
or by other trouble, I could not say for certain, but presently
I based my suspicions on certain facts which I
happened to notice, besides the presence of symptoms
indicating great nervous depression and strain, extreme
weakness of the spine and oscillations of the hands when
spread horizontally with the fingers and thumbs wide apart.
This may in one way be accounted for by the difficulty that
men have in obtaining wives, owing to the scarcity of
women. Apoplectic and epileptic fits and convulsions were
not of very frequent occurrence, but they seemed severe
when they did occur. The fire cure was usually applied in
order to drive away the spirits that were supposed to have
entered the body, but, all the same, these fits at times
resulted in temporary or occasionally permanent paralysis,
and much derangement and disfiguration of the facial
expression, particularly about the eyes and mouth. I had
occasion to study three very good specimens of this kind
at Tucker, at Tarbar, north of the Brahmaputra River, and
at Tokchim.</p>

<p>Much to my regret I never came across any violent cases
of insanity during my stay in the country, though many
times I observed strange peculiarities among the men, and
signs of mania, more particularly religious.</p>

<p>In women I several times noticed symptoms of melancholia,
caused no doubt by abuse of sexual intercourse,
owing to their strange laws of polyandry. I was told that
occasionally it led to suicide by drowning or strangulation.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_264" id="Pg_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>
However, I was never able to keep any of the suspicious
cases under close observation for any length of time, and,
as our arrival into Tibetan camps generally created some
amount of fear and sensation, and we usually left before
they could be quite at home with us, I never had a chance
of studying the subject more closely.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Strange</span> as the Tibetan remedies seemed to be, none came
up, as far as interest went, to one I saw applied at a place
called Kutzia. I had entered a camp of some twenty or
thirty tents, when my attention was drawn to an excited
crowd collected round an old man whose garments had
been removed. He was tightly bound with ropes, and
agony was depicted on his features. A tall, long-haired
man with red coat and heavy boots knelt by the side of
the sufferer and prayed fervently, twirling round a prayer-wheel
which he held in his right hand.</p>

<p>My curiosity aroused, I approached the gathering, whereupon
three or four Tibetans got up and signed to me to be
off. I pretended not to understand, and, after a heated
discussion, I was allowed to remain.</p>

<p>An operation was obviously being performed by a Tibetan
medicine-man, and the suspense in the crowd round the sick
man was considerable. The doctor was busy preparing
combustible fuses, which he wrapped up carefully in silk
paper. When cut in the centre they formed two cones, each
with a little tail of twisted paper protruding beyond its
summit. Having completed six or eight of these, the
medicine-man made his patient, or rather his victim, assume
a sitting posture. I inquired what ailed the sick man. From
what they told me, and from an examination made on my
own account, I was satisfied that the man was suffering
from an attack of lumbago. The coming cure, however,
interested me more than the illness itself, and the doctor,
seeing how absorbed I was in the performance, asked me to
sit by his side. First of all the man called for &quot;fire,&quot; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_266" id="Pg_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>
a woman handed him a blazing brand from a fire near by.
He swung it to and fro in the air, and pronounced certain
exorcisms. Next the patient was subjected to a thorough
examination, giving vent to a piercing yell each time that the
long bony fingers of the physician touched his sides, whereupon
the man of science, pointing to the spot, informed
his open-mouthed audience that the pain was &quot;there.&quot;
Putting on a huge pair of spectacles, he rubbed with
the palm of his hand the umbilical region of the sufferer
and then measured with folded thumb two inches on each
side of, and slightly under, the umbilicus. To mark these
distances he used the burning brand, applying it to the flesh
at these points.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Murr, murr!</i>&quot; (&quot;Butter, butter!&quot;) he next called for, and
butter was produced. Having rubbed a little on the burns,
he placed upon each of them a separate cone, and pressed
until it remained a fixture, the point upwards. Shifting the
beads of a rosary, revolving the praying-wheel, and muttering
prayers, the medicine-man now worked himself into a perfect
frenzy. He stared at the sun, raising his voice from a faint
whisper to a thundering baritone at its loudest, and his
whole audience seemed so affected by the performance that
they all shook and trembled and prayed in their terror. He
now again nervously clutched the burning wood in one
hand, and, blowing upon it with the full strength of his lungs,
produced a flame. The excitement in the crowd became
intense. Every one, head down to the ground, prayed
fervently. The doctor waved the ignited wood three
or four times in the air and then applied the flames to the
paper tips of the combustible cones. Apparently saltpetre
and sulphur had been mixed in the preparation of these.
They burned fast, making a noise like the fuse of a rocket.</p>

<p>At this juncture the animation of the onlookers was not
to be compared with the agitation of the patient, who began
to feel the effects of this primitive remedy. The fire
spluttered on his bare skin. The cure was doing its work.
The wretched man's mouth foamed, and his eyes bulged
out of their sockets. He moaned and groaned, making
desperate efforts to unloose the bonds that kept his
hands fast behind his back. Two stalwart men sprang
forward and held him, while the medicine-man and all the
women present, leaning over the prostrate form, blew with
all their might upon what remained of the three smoking
cones frizzling away into the flesh of the wretched victim.</p>

<p>The pain of which the man complained seemed to encircle
his waist, wherefore the strange physician, having
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_267" id="Pg_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
untied his patient's arms from behind, and retied them in
front, began his measurements again, this time from the
spinal column.</p>

<div class="clearfix"><div class="figleft">
<a href="./images/267.jpg">
<img src="./images/267_th.jpg" alt="A Medicine-man" title="A Medicine-man" /></a><br />
A Medicine-man</div>
<p>&quot;<i>Chik, ni, sum!</i>&quot; (&quot;One, two, three!&quot;) he exclaimed,
as he marked the three spots in the same fashion as before, smeared them
over with butter, and affixed the cones. Here ensued a repetition of the
previous excitement; prayers, agony, and distortions, but the patient was
not thoroughly cured, and more cones were subsequently ignited on both
his sides, in spite of his protests and my appeals on his behalf. The
poor fellow soon had a regular circle of severe burns round his body.</p>

<p>Needless to say, when, two hours later, the operation was over, the sick
man had become a dying man. With a view to obtaining a few hints on
Tibetan medicine from this eminent physician&mdash;the Tibetans held him
in great esteem&mdash;I sent him a small present and requested him to
visit me. He was flattered and showed no desire to keep his methods a
secret, but even pressed me to try some of his unique remedies.</p>

<p>According to him, fire would cure most illnesses; what fire could not
cure, water would. He had, nevertheless, some small packets of variously
coloured powders, for which he claimed extraordinary powers.</p>

<p>&quot;I am afraid your patient will die,&quot; I remarked.</p>

<p>&quot;He may,&quot; was the reply, &quot;but it will be the fault of the
patient, not the cure. Besides, what does it matter whether
you die to-day or to-morrow?&quot;</p>

<p>And with this unprofessional dictum he left me.</p></div>

<h5>Tucker village&mdash;Chokdens&mdash;Houses&mdash;Flying prayers&mdash;Soldiers
or robbers?&mdash;A stampede&mdash;Fresh provisions&mdash;Disappointment&mdash;Treachery&mdash;Shokas
leave me&mdash;Observations&mdash;Five
men, all counted!</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> I left the Gomba, having been salaamed to the
ground by my new friends the Lamas, I walked about the
village to examine all there was to be seen.</p>

<p>Along the water's edge stood a number of dilapidated
Chokdens made of mud and stones, with a square base
surmounted by a moulding, and an upper decoration in
steps, topped by a cylindrical column. They were in a row
at the east end of the village, and, as is well known, they
are supposed to contain a piece of bone, cloth or metal,
and books or parts of them, that had once belonged
to a great man or a saint. Roughly drawn images are
occasionally found in them. In rare cases, when cremation
has been applied, the ashes are collected into a small
earthenware urn, and deposited in one of the Chokdens.
The ashes are usually made into a paste with clay, on which,
when flattened like a medallion, a representation of Buddha
is either stamped from a mould, or engraved by means of a
pointed tool.</p>

<p>The interior of the houses at Tucker was no more
pleasing than the exterior. Each habitation had a walled
courtyard, and the top of the wall, as well as the edge of the
flat roof, was lined with masses of tamarisk for fuel. In the
courtyard, sheep and goats were penned at night; and the
human beings who occupied the rooms were dirty beyond
all description. There were hundreds of flying prayers over
the monastery as well as over each house, and as the
people stood on their roofs watching us, laughing and
chatting, the place had quite a gay aspect.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_269" id="Pg_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
While I was strolling about some fifty or sixty men
appeared on the scene, armed with matchlocks and swords,
and I looked upon them with suspicion, but Kachi
reassured me, and said they were not soldiers, but a
powerful band of robbers encamped about half a mile off,
and on very friendly terms with the Lamas. As a precaution,
I loaded my rifle, which was quite sufficient to
occasion a stampede of the armed crowd, followed, in the
panic, by all the other villagers that had collected round
us. Like all Tibetans, they were a miserable lot, though
powerfully built, and with plenty of bounce about them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Early in the morning I had made inquiries about provisions,
and had arranged for the purchase of two fat sheep
and some 450 lbs. of food (flour, rice, <i>tsamba, ghur</i>, sugar,
salt and butter), and several Tibetans stated that they could
supply me with any quantity I required. Among others was
a trader from Buddhi, Darcey Bura's brother, who promised
to bring me within an hour a sufficient quantity of food to
last us ten men twenty-five days. I noticed, when these
men left, that two of my Shokas ran after them, and entered
into an excited discussion with them. Some two or three
hours later, the traders returned, swearing that not an
ounce of food could be obtained in the place. The way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_270" id="Pg_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
in which these men could lie was indeed marvellous to
study. I suspected treachery, and reprimanded my Shokas,
threatening to punish them very severely if my suspicions
proved to be well founded.</p>

<p>The Shokas, knowing themselves discovered, and partly
through fear of the Tibetans, were now again quite
unreasonable and demoralised. It was no use keeping
them by force and I decided to discharge them. From
the moment I had entered the forbidden country I had
been compelled to protect myself against them as much
as against the Tibetans. I reflected, however, when I
made up my mind to let them go, that these fellows had
stood for my sake hardships and privations which few men
could stand; and in paying them off I therefore rewarded
them suitably, and they undertook to bring back safely
across the frontier part of my baggage containing photographs,
ethnological collections, &amp;c. With infinite trouble
I then managed to purchase enough provisions to last five
men ten days.</p>

<p>The whole party accompanied me three-and-a-quarter
miles farther, where, in sight of the tumble-down Panku
Gomba, a mile to the West of us, we halted in order to make
the necessary arrangements for our parting, unseen by the
Tibetans. I took observations for latitude and longitude.
The water of the hypsometrical apparatus boiled at 185&deg;
Fahr. fifty feet above the level of the lake, the temperature
of the air being 76&deg; and the hour 10 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span></p>

<p>We had a high snowy chain to the South of us, extending
from 70&deg; to 33&deg; (b.m.), the direction of the range being
approximately from South-West to North-East, starting at
Nimo Namgil.</p>

<p>When everything was ready, the five Shokas, including
Kachi and Dola, left me, swearing by the sun and all that
they hold most sacred, that they would in no way betray
me to the Tibetans, who so far had no suspicion as to
who I was.</p>

<p>Bijesing the Johari and the Kutial Bura Nattoo agreed to
accompany me as far as the Maium Pass, so that my party,
including myself, now was reduced to only five.</p>

<h5>The start with a further reduced party&mdash;A reconnaissance&mdash;Natural
fortress&mdash;Black tents and animals&mdash;On the wrong
tack&mdash;Slings and their use&mdash;A visit to a Tibetan camp&mdash;Mistaken
for brigands&mdash;Bargaining and begging.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> was promising well when, with my reduced party, I
started towards the N.E., first following for three-and-a-quarter
miles a course of 49&deg;,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> skirting the lake, then ascending
over the barren hill ranges in a direction of 90&deg; for
a distance of twelve miles. The journey was uneventful,
and my four men seemed in the best of spirits. We descended
to a plain where water and grass could be found,
and having seen a camping-ground with a protecting wall,
such as are usually put up by Tibetans at their halting-places,
we made ourselves comfortable for the night, notwithstanding
the high wind and a passing storm of hail and
rain, which drenched us to the skin. The thermometer
during the night went down to 34&deg;.</p>

<p>At sunrise I started to make a reconnaissance from the
top of a high hill wherefrom I could get a bird's-eye view
of a great portion of the surrounding country. It was of
the utmost importance for me to find out which would be
the easiest way to get through the intricate succession of
hills and mountains, and to discover the exact direction
of a large river to the N. of us, throwing itself into the
Mansarowar, the name of which no one could tell me.
I started alone towards 352&deg; 30&#8242; (b.m.), and three-and-a-half
miles' climb brought me to 16,480 feet on the
summit of a hill, where I was able to ascertain and note
down all that I wished to know. I returned to camp, and
we went on towards 73&deg; 30&#8242;, crossing over a pass 16,450 feet,
and ultimately finding ourselves at the foot of a hill, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_272" id="Pg_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
summit of which resembled a fortress, with flying-prayers
flapping to and fro in the wind. At the foot of the hill
were some twenty ponies grazing.</p>

<div class="clearfix"><div class="figleft">
<a href="./images/272.jpg">
<img src="./images/272_th.jpg" alt="Sling" title="Sling" /></a><br />
Sling</div>
<p>With the aid of my telescope I was able to make sure
that what at first appeared to be a castle was nothing but a
work of nature, and that apparently no one was concealed
up there. The ponies, however, indicated the presence of
men, and we had to move cautiously. In fact, rounding
the next hill, we discerned in the grassy valley below a
number of black tents, two hundred yaks, and about a
thousand sheep. We kept well out of sight behind the
hill, and making a long d&eacute;tour, we at last descended
in an extensive valley, in which the river described
a semicircle, washing the southern hill ranges, where
it was joined by a tributary coming from the S.E.
This tributary at first appeared to me larger than
what I afterwards recognised to be the main stream,
so that I followed its course for four miles (92&deg;
30&#8242; b.m.), till I found that it was taking me in a more
southerly direction than I wished, and had to retrace
my steps along a flattish plateau. Meeting two
Tibetan women, I purchased, after endless trouble,
a fat sheep out of a flock they were driving before
them. These two females carried rope slings in their
hands, and the accuracy with which they could fling
stones and hit the mark at very great distances was
really marvellous. For the sake of a few annas they
gave an exhibition of their skill, hitting any sheep
you pointed at in their flock, even at distances of
thirty and forty yards. I tried to obtain from these
dangerous females a little information about the
country, but they professed absolute ignorance.</p>

<p>&quot;We are menials,&quot; they said, &quot;and we know nothing.
We know each sheep in our flock, and that is all, but our
lord, of whom we are the slaves, knows all. He knows
where the rivers come from, and the ways to all Gombas.
He is a great king.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And where does he live?&quot; I inquired.</p>

<p>&quot;There, two miles off, where that smoke rises to the
sky.&quot;</p>

<p>The temptation was great to go and call on this &quot;great
king,&quot; who knew so many things, all the more so as we
might probably persuade him to sell us provisions, which,
as we had none too many, would be of great assistance to
us. Anyhow the visit would be interesting, and I decided
to risk it.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_274" id="Pg_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span></p>

<p>We steered towards the several columns of smoke that
rose before us, and eventually we approached a large camp
of black tents. Our appearance caused a good deal of
commotion, and men and women rushed in and out of
their tents in great excitement.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Jogpas, jogpas!</i>&quot; (&quot;Brigands! brigands!&quot;) somebody
in their camp shouted, and in a moment their matchlocks
were made ready, and the few men who had
remained outside the tents drew their swords, holding them
clumsily in their hands in a way hardly likely to terrify any
one.</p>

<p>To be taken for brigands was a novel experience for us,
and the warlike array was in strange contrast to the terrified
expressions on the faces of those who stood there armed.
In fact, when Chanden Sing and I walked forward and
encouraged them to sheathe their steels and put their matchlocks
by, they readily followed our advice, and brought
out rugs for us to sit upon. Having overcome their fright,
they were now most anxious to be pleasant.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Kiula gunge gozai deva labod&ugrave;!</i>&quot; (&quot;You have nice
clothes!&quot;) I began the conversation, attempting flattery,
to put the chieftain at his ease.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Lasso, leh!</i>&quot; ( &quot;Yes, sir&quot;) answered the Tibetan, apparently
astonished, and looking at his own attire with an air
of comical pride.</p>

<p>His answer was sufficient to show me that the man considered me his
superior, the affirmative in Tibetan to an equal or inferior being the
mere word <i>lasso</i> without the <i>leh</i>.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Kiula tuku taka zando?</i>&quot; (&quot;How many children have
you?&quot;) I rejoined.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ni</i>.&quot; (&quot;Two.&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Chuwen bogpe, tsamba, chou won&#464;?</i>&quot; (&quot;Will you sell
me flour or <i>tsamba?</i>&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Midd&ugrave;</i>&mdash;have not got any,&quot; he replied, making
several quick semicircular movements with the up-turned palm of his right
hand.</p>

<p>This is a most characteristic action of the Tibetan, and nearly
invariably accompanies the word &quot;No,&quot; instead of a movement of
the head, as with us.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_275" id="Pg_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>&quot;<i>Keran ga naddoung?</i>&quot; (&quot;Where are you going?&quot;) he
asked me eagerly.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Nhgarang ne Koroun!</i>&quot; (&quot;I am a pilgrim!&quot;) &quot;<i>Lungba
quorghen neh jelghen</i>.&quot; (&quot;I go looking at sacred places.&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gopria zaldo. Chakzal wortzi&eacute;. Tsamba midd&ugrave;. Bogpe
midd&ugrave;, guram midd&ugrave;, di&eacute; midd&ugrave;, kassur midd&ugrave;.</i>&quot; (&quot;I am
very poor. Please hear me. I have no <i>tsamba</i>, no flour,
no sweet paste, no rice, no dried fruit.&quot;)</p>

<p>This, of course, I knew to be untrue, so I calmly said that
I would remain seated where I was until food was sold
to me, and at the same time produced one or two silver
coins, the display of which to the covetous eyes of the
Tibetans was always the means of hastening the transaction
of business. In small handfuls, after each of which the
Tibetans swore that they had not another atom to sell, I
managed, with somewhat of a trial to my patience, to purchase
some twenty pounds of food. The moment the money
was handed over they had a quarrel among themselves
about it, and almost came to blows, greed and avarice being
the most marked characteristic of the Tibetans. No Tibetan
of any rank is ashamed to beg in the most abject manner
for the smallest silver coin, and when he sells and is paid,
he always implores for another coin, to be thrown into the
bargain.</p>

<h5>What the men were like&mdash;Their timidity&mdash;Leather work&mdash;Metal
work&mdash;Blades and swords&mdash;Filigree&mdash;Saddles and harness&mdash;Pack
saddles.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> men of the party were extremely picturesque, with
hair flowing down their shoulders and long pigtails ornamented
with pieces of red cloth, circles of ivory and silver
coins. Nearly all had the stereotyped pattern coat, with
ample sleeves hanging well over the hands, and pulled up at
the waist to receive the paraphernalia of eating-bowls, snuff-box,
&amp;c., employed in daily life. Most of them were dressed
in dark red, and all were armed with jewelled swords.</p>

<p>With flat, broad noses and slits of piercing eyes, high cheek-bones
and skin giving out abundant oily excretions, most of
the men stood at a respectful distance, scrutinising our faces
and watching our movements apparently with much interest.
I have hardly ever seen such cowardice and timidity as among
these big, hulking fellows; to a European it scarcely seems
conceivable. The mere raising of one's eyes was sufficient
to make a man dash away frightened, and, with the exception
of the chief, who pretended to be unafraid, notwithstanding
that even he was trembling with fear, they one and all
showed ridiculous nervousness when I approached them to
examine their clothes or the ornaments they wore round
their necks, the most prominent of which were the charm-boxes
that dangled on their chests. The larger of these
charm-boxes contained an image of Budda, the others were
mere brass or silver cases with nothing in them.</p>

<p>I was struck here, as well as in other camps, by the skill
of the Tibetans in working leather, which they tan and
prepare themselves, often giving to it a fine red or green
colour. As a rule, however, the natural tint is preserved,
especially when the leather is used for belts, bullet and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_277" id="Pg_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span>
powder-pouches, and flint-and-steel cases. The hair of the
skins is removed by plucking and scraping, and preference is shown for
skins of the yak, antelope, and kiang. The Tibetans are masters of the
art of skinning, the hides being afterwards beaten, trodden upon and
manipulated to be rendered soft. There were simple ornamentations stamped
upon some of the leather articles, but in most instances either metal or
leather ornaments of various colours were fastened on the belts and
pouches, iron clasps inlaid with silver or silver ones being the
commonest.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<img src="./images/277_th.jpg" alt="Tibetan Young Man" title="Tibetan Young Man" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Tibetan Young Man</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>These metals are found in the country, and the Tibetans smelt and cast
the ore when sufficient fuel is obtainable for the purpose. Earthen
crucibles are employed to liquefy the metals, and the castings are made
in clay moulds. For the inlaid work, in which the Tibetans greatly
excel, they use hammer and chisel. Inlaid ornamentation is
frequently to be seen on the sheaths of Tibetan swords, the
leaf pattern, varied scrolls and geometrical combinations
being most commonly preferred. The process of hardening
metals is still in its infancy, and Tibetan blades are of
wrought-iron, and not of steel. They succeed, however, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_278" id="Pg_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>
bringing them to a wonderful degree of sharpness, although
they entirely lack the elasticity of steel blades. Grooves to
let in air, and thus make wounds incurable, are generally
ground in the sides of the daggers, but the blades of the
common swords are perfectly smooth and made to cut on
one side only. As can be seen from the illustrations, these
weapons are hardly adapted to meet the requirements of
severe fighting, as they do not allow a firm grip, nor have
they any guard for the hand. The sheaths and handles of
some of the more valuable swords are made of solid silver
inlaid with turquoises and coral beads, others of silver with
gold ornamentations. At Lhassa and at Sigatz (Shigatze),
silver filigree decorations are used on the best daggers; but
nowhere else in Tibet is fine wire-making practised.</p>

<img src="./images/278_th.jpg" alt="Swords" title="Swords" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Swords</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>It must not be inferred from the above remarks that there
are no steel swords in Tibet, for indeed many fine blades of
excellent Chinese steel can be seen all over the country in
the possession of the richer officials, such as the huge two-handed,
double-edged swords of Chinese importation, used
by Tibetan executioners.</p>

<p>The saddles, though possibly lacking comfort, are nevertheless
skilfully made. The frame is made of solid wood
(imported) and set in hammered iron (often inlaid with silver
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_279" id="Pg_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>
and gold, as in the saddle here reproduced), which, like a
Mexican saddle, is very high in front and at the back. Lizard skin or
coloured leather is employed to decorate certain parts, and a pad covers
the seat. A rug is, however, invariably placed over this pad for comfort,
and the short iron stirrups compel one to sit with legs doubled up, a
really not uncomfortable position when one gets used to it. Breastpiece,
crupper, bridle and bit are of leather ornamented with inlaid metal
pieces. Double bags for <i>tsamba</i>, butter, &amp;c. are fastened behind the
saddle, together with the inevitable peg and long rope, with which no
Tibetan rider is unprovided, for the tethering of his pony at night.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Saddle</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Pack-saddles for yaks are made on the same principle, but
are of much rougher construction, as can be judged from the
illustrations,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> in which the two saddles I used on my journey
are represented. The baggage is made fast by means of
ropes to the two upper bars. To keep the saddle in position
on the yak, and to prevent sores being inflicted, pads
and blankets are laid upon the animal's back. Add to this
protection the long coat possessed by the beast itself, and
it will be clear why it very seldom sustains the slightest
injury from these apparently cruel burdens.</p>

<h5>Rain in torrents&mdash;A miserable night&mdash;A gorge&mdash;A gigantic
inscription&mdash;Sheltered under boulders&mdash;A fresh surprise&mdash;Only
two followers left.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> night came on, I did not consider it safe to
encamp near the Tibetans. We moved away, driving our
yaks before us and dragging the newly purchased sheep.
We marched two-and-a-half miles, and then halted in a
depression in the ground (16,050 feet), where we had a
little shelter from the wind, which blew with great force.
To our right lay a short range of fairly high mountains
running from North to South, and cut by a gorge, out of
which flowed a large stream. At that time of the evening
we could not hope to cross it, but an attempt might be made
in the morning, when the cold of the night would have
checked the melting of the snows. Heavy showers had
fallen frequently during the day, and the moment the sun
went down there was a regular downpour. Our little <i>tente-d'abri</i>
had been pitched, but we had to clear out of it a couple
of hours later, the small basin in which we had pitched
it having been turned into a regular pond. There was no
alternative for us but to come out into the open, for where
the water did not flood us the wind was so high and the
ground so moist that it was not possible to keep our tent up.
The pegs would not hold. The hours of the night seemed
very long as we sat tightly wrapped up in our waterproofs,
with feet, hands and ears frozen, and the water dripping
down upon us. At dawn there were no signs of the storm
abating. We had not been able to light a fire in the
evening, nor could we light one now, and we were cold,
hungry and miserable. The thermometer had been down
to 36&deg;. Towards noon, the rain still pouring down in
torrents and there being no sign of its clearing, we loaded</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_282" id="Pg_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
our yaks and entered the gorge between the snow-covered
mountains. With difficulty we crossed the tributary we
had so far followed, and then proceeded along the right
bank of the main stream to 23&deg; 30&#8243;, then to 25&deg;.</p>

<p>We were so exhausted and wet that, when towards evening
we came to an enormous cliff, on the rocky face of
which a patient Lama sculptor had engraved in gigantic
letters the everlasting characters, <i>Omne mani padme hun</i>,
we halted. The gorge was very narrow here, and we
managed to find a dry spot under a big boulder, but as
there was not sufficient room for all five, the two Shokas
went under the shelter of another rock a little way off.
This seemed natural enough, nor could I anticipate any
danger, taking care myself of the weapons and the scientific
instruments, while the Shokas had under their own sheltering
boulder the bags containing nearly all our provisions
except tinned meats. The rain pelted all night, the wind
howled, and again we could not light a fire. The thermometer
did not fall below 38&deg;, but the cold, owing to our
drenched condition, seemed intense. In fact, we were so
frozen that we did not venture to eat, but, crouching ourselves
in the small dry space at our disposal, we eventually
fell fast asleep without tasting food. I slept soundly for the
first time since I had been in Tibet, and it was broad daylight
when I woke up, to find the man Nattoo from Kuti,
and Bijesing the Johari, departed from under their sheltering
rock, together with the loads entrusted to them. I discovered
their tracks, half washed away, in the direction
from which we had come the previous night. The rascals
had bolted, and there would have been comparatively little
harm in that, if only they had not taken with them all the
stock of provisions for my two Hindoo servants, and a
quantity of good rope, straps, and other miscellaneous
articles, which we were bound to miss at every turn and
which we had absolutely no means of replacing.</p>

<p>Of thirty picked servants who had started with me, twenty-eight
had now abandoned me, and only two remained:
faithful Chanden Sing and Mansing the leper!</p>

<p>The weather continued horrible, with no food for my men
and no fuel! I proposed to the two to go back also and let
me continue alone. I described to them the dangers of
following me farther, and warned them fully, but they
absolutely refused to leave me.</p>

<p>&quot;Sahib, we are not Shokas,&quot; were their words. &quot;If you
die, we will die with you. We fear not death. We are
sorry to see you suffer, sahib, but never mind us. We are
only poor people, therefore it is of no consequence.&quot;</p>

<h5>My time fully occupied&mdash;Our own yak drivers&mdash;A heavy blow&mdash;Along
the stream&mdash;Soldiers in pursuit of us&mdash;Discovered.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> last disaster should, I suppose, have deterred us from
further progress, but it somehow made me even more determined
to persist than I was before. It was no light job to
have to run afield oneself to capture the yaks, which had
wandered off in search of grass; and having found them
and driven them back to our primitive camping-place,
to tie upon their backs the pack-saddles, and fasten on
them the heavy tin-lined cases of scientific instruments and
photographic plates. This task was only part of the day's
routine, which included the writing up of my diary, the
registering of observations, sketching, photographing,
changing plates in cameras, occasionally developing them,
surveying, cleaning of rifles, revolver, &amp;c. &amp;c. The effort
of lifting up the heavy cases on to the pack-saddles was,
owing to our exhausted condition, a severe tax on our
strength, and the tantalising restlessness of the yaks forced
us to make several attempts before we actually succeeded in
properly fastening the loads, particularly as we had lost our
best pieces of rope and leather straps. Our sole remaining
piece of rope seemed hardly long enough to make the final
knot to one of the girths; anyhow neither my bearer nor
Mansing had sufficient strength to pull and make it join; so
I made them hold the yak by the horns to keep him steady
while I pulled my hardest. I succeeded with a great effort,
and was about to get up, when a terrific blow from the yak's
horn struck me in the skull an inch behind my right ear
and sent me rolling head over heels. I was stunned for
several moments, and the back of my head was swollen and
sore for many days, the mark of the blow being visible
even now.</p>

<p>We proceeded along the right bank of the river on a course
of 85&deg; between reddish hills and distant high snowy mountains
to the N.W. and E.S.E. of us, which we saw from time
to time when the rain ceased and the sky cleared. The
momentary lifting of the clouds would be followed by
another downpour, and the marching became very unpleasant
and difficult, as we sank deep in the mud. Towards
evening, we suddenly discovered some hundred and fifty
soldiers riding full gallop in pursuit of us along the river
valley. We pushed on, and having got out of their sight
behind a hill, we deviated from our course and rapidly
climbed up to the top of the hill range; my two men
and the yaks concealed themselves on the other side. I
remained lying flat on the top of the hill, spying with my
telescope the movements of our pursuers. They rode
unsuspectingly on, the tinkling of their horse-bells sounding
pleasant to the ear at that deserted spot. They made
a pretty picture, and, thinking probably that we had continued
our way along the river, they rode past the spot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_285" id="Pg_285"></a>[<a href="./images/285.png">285</a>]</span>
where we had left the path, and, possibly owing to their
haste to catch us up, did not notice our tracks up the hillside.</p>

<p>Rain began to fall heavily again, and we remained encamped
at 17,000 feet with all our loads ready for flight at
any moment; the night being spent none too comfortably.
I sat up all night, rifle in hand, in case of a surprise, and I
was indeed glad when day dawned. The rain had stopped,
but we were now enveloped in a white mist which chilled
us. I was very tired, and telling Chanden Sing to keep a
sharp watch, tried to sleep for a while.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p>&quot;<i>Hazur, hazur! jaldi apka banduk!</i>&quot; (&quot;Sir, sir, quick,
your rifle!&quot;) muttered my bearer, rousing me. &quot;Do you
hear the sound of bells?&quot;</p>

<p>The tinkling was quite plain. As our pursuers were approaching,
evidently in a strong body, there was no time to
be lost. To successfully evade them appeared impossible, so
I decided to meet them, rather than attempt flight. Chanden
Sing and I were armed with our rifles, and Mansing with his
Gourkha <i>kukri</i>, and thus we awaited their arrival. There
came out of the mist a long procession of grey, phantomlike
figures, each one leading a pony. The advance guard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_286" id="Pg_286"></a>[<a href="./images/286.png">286</a>]</span>
stopped from time to time to examine the ground; having
discovered our footprints only partially washed away by the
rain, they were following them up. Seeing us at last on
the top of the hill, they halted. There was commotion
among them, and they held an excited consultation; some
of them unslung their matchlocks, others drew their swords,
while we sat on a rock above and watched them with
undivided attention.</p>

<h5>An interview&mdash;Peace or war?&mdash;Gifts and the scarf of friendship&mdash;The
<i>Kata</i>&mdash;The end of a friendly visit.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> hesitating a little, four officers signalled to us that
they wished to approach.</p>

<p>&quot;You are a great king!&quot; shouted one at the top of his
voice, &quot;and we want to lay these presents at your feet,&quot;
and he pointed to some small bags which the other three
men were carrying. &quot;<i>Gelbo! Chakzal! Chakzal!</i>&quot; (&quot;We
salute you, king!&quot;)</p>

<p>I felt anything but regal after the wretched night we had
spent, but I wished to treat the natives with due deference
and politeness whenever it was possible.</p>

<p>I said that four men might approach, but the bulk of the
party was to withdraw to a spot about two hundred yards
away. This they immediately did, a matter of some surprise
to me after the warlike attitude they had assumed at
first. They laid their matchlocks down in the humblest
fashion, and duly replaced their swords in their sheaths.
The four officers approached, and when quite close to
us, threw the bags on the ground and opened them
to show us their contents. There was <i>tsamba</i>, flour, <i>chura</i>
(a kind of cheese), <i>guram</i> (sweet paste), butter, and dried
fruit. The officers were most profuse in their humble
salutations. They had removed their caps and thrown
them on the ground, and they kept their tongues sticking
out of their mouths until I begged them to draw
them in. They professed to be the subordinates of the
Tokchim Tarjum, who had despatched them to inquire
after my health, and who wished me to look upon him as
my best friend. Well aware of the difficulties we must
encounter in travelling through such an inhospitable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_288" id="Pg_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
country, the Tarjum, they said, wished me to accept the
gifts they now laid before me, and with these they handed
me a <i>Kata</i>, or &quot;the scarf of love and friendship,&quot; a long
piece of thin silklike gauze, the end of which had been cut into a
fringe. In Tibet these <i>Katas</i> accompany every gift, and no caller ever
goes about without one, which instantly on arrival he produces for
presentation to his host. The high Lamas sell them to devotees, and one
or more of these scarves is presented to those who leave a satisfactory
oblation after visiting a lamasery and temple. If a verbal message is
sent to a friend, a <i>Kata</i> is sent with it, and among officials and Lamas
small pieces of this silk gauze are enclosed even in letters. Not to give
or send a <i>Kata</i> to an honoured visitor is considered a breach of good
manners and is equivalent to a slight.</p>

<p class="figcenter">A Kata</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>I hastened to express my thanks for the Tarjum's kindness, and I handed
the messengers a sum in silver of three times the value of the articles
presented. The men seemed very pleasant and friendly, and we chatted for
some time. Much to my annoyance, poor Mansing, bewildered at the sight of
so much food, could no longer resist the pangs of hunger and, caring
little for the breach of etiquette and likely consequences, proceeded to
fill his mouth with handfuls of flour, cheese and butter. This led the
Tibetans to suspect that we must be starving, and with their usual
shrewdness they determined to take advantage of it.</p>

<p>&quot;The Tarjum,&quot; said the oldest of the messengers,
&quot;wishes you to come back and be his guest, when he will
feed you and your men, and you will then go back to your
country.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you,&quot; I replied; &quot;we do not want the Tarjum's
food, nor do we wish to go back. I am greatly obliged for
his kindness, but we will continue our journey.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_289" id="Pg_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>&quot;Then,&quot; angrily said a young and powerful Tibetan, &quot;if
you continue your journey we will take back our gifts.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And your <i>Kata!</i>&quot; I rejoined, sending first the large ball
of butter flying into his chest, and after it the small bags of
flour, <i>tsamba</i>, cheese, fruit, &amp;c., a minute earlier prettily laid
out before us.</p>

<p>This unexpected bombardment quite upset the Tibetans,
who, with powdered coats, hair and faces, scampered
away as best they could, while Chanden Sing, always as
quick as lightning when it was a case of hitting, pounded
away with the butt of his rifle at the roundest part of one
ambassador's body, as in his clumsy clothes he attempted
to get up and run.</p>

<p>Mansing, the philosopher of our party, interrupted in his
feed but not put out, nor concerned in what was going on,
picked up the fruit and cheese and pieces of butter scattered
all over the place, mumbling that it was a shame to
throw away good food in such a reckless fashion.</p>

<p>The soldiers, who had been watching attentively from
a distance the different phases of the interview, considered
it prudent to beat a hasty retreat, and, mounting
their steeds with unmistakable dispatch, galloped pell-mell
down the hill, and then along the valley of the
river, until they were lost to sight in the mist, while the
poor ambassadors, who had been unable to rejoin their
ponies, followed as quickly as possible under the circumstances,
considering the rarefied air and rough ground.</p>

<p>Their cries of distress, caused by fear alone, for we had
done them no harm, served to strengthen the contempt in
which my men by now held the Tibetan soldiers and their
officers.</p>

<p>The scene really was comical, and I made as much
capital as I could out of it, laughing with my companions
and ridiculing to them the supposed valour of Tibetans.</p>

<p>When the Tibetans were out of sight, Chanden Sing and
I pocketed our pride and helped Mansing to collect the
dried dates, apricots, the pieces of <i>chura</i>, butter and <i>guram</i>.
Then having loaded our yaks we marched on.</p>

<h5>Rain in torrents&mdash;A swampy plain&mdash;The sun at last&mdash;Our yaks
stolen and recovered.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were not in luck. The weather continued squally
in the morning, and in the afternoon the rain was again
torrential. We went towards 78&deg; over uninteresting and
monotonous grey country with a chain of snowy peaks
stretching from South-West to North-East. We waded
through a fairly deep and very cold river, and subsequently
rose over a pass 17,450 feet. A number of
Hunyas, with flocks of several thousand sheep, came in
sight, but we avoided them. They did not see us.</p>

<p>At the point where we crossed it, the main stream turns
in a graceful bend to 140&deg; (b.m.). We climbed over hilly and
barren country to an altitude of 17,550 feet, where several
small lakelets were to be found, and, having marched in all
fourteen and a-half miles in a drenching rain, we descended
into a large valley. Here we had great difficulty in finding
a spot where to rest for the night. The plain was simply a
swamp, with several lakes and ponds, and we sank everywhere
in mud and water. All our bedding and clothes were
soaked to such an extent that it really made no difference
where we halted; so we pitched our little tent on the
banks of a stream coming out of a valley to the North,
from which, extending in an easterly direction, rose a series
of pyramidal mountains, covered with snow, and all of
almost equal height and base. To the South were high
peaks with great quantities of snow upon them. This
valley was at an elevation of 17,450 feet, and the cold was
intense.</p>

<p>At night the rain came down in bucketsful, and our
<i>tente d'abri</i> gave us but little shelter. We were lying
inside in water, and all the trenches in the world could not</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_292" id="Pg_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
have kept it from streaming in. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say
that the whole valley was a sheet of water from one to several inches
deep. Of course, we suffered intensely from cold, the thermometer
dropping to 26&deg; at 8 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, when a South-East wind blew furiously; and
the rain fell mixed with sleet for a time, and was followed by a heavy
snowstorm. We lay crouched up on the top of our baggage, so as not to
sleep on the frozen water, and when we woke in the morning our tent had
half collapsed owing to the weight of snow upon it. During the day the
temperature went up and rain fell afresh, so that when we resumed our
marching, we sank into a mixture of mud, snow and water several inches
deep. We had to cross three rivers, and to skirt five lakes of various
sizes, following a course of 83&deg; 45&#8242;.</p>

<p>Seven miles of this dreary marching saw us encamped (17,380 feet) by the
foot of a conical hill 17,500 feet, where an almost identical repetition
of the previous night's experience took place. The thermometer was down
to 32&deg;, but fortunately the wind subsided at eight in the evening. As
luck would have it, the sun came out the following day, and we were able
to spread out all our things to dry, during which process we had yet
another novel experience.</p>

<p>Our two yaks had disappeared. I climbed up to the
summit of the hill above camp, and with my telescope
scoured the plain. The two animals were some distance off
being led away by ten or twelve men on horseback, who
drove in front of them a flock of about five hundred sheep.
By their clothing I recognised the strangers to be robbers.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_293" id="Pg_293"></a>[<a href="./images/293.png">293</a>]</span>
Naturally I started post haste to recover my property,
leaving Chanden Sing and Mansing in charge of our camp.
I caught them up as they marched slowly, though, when they
perceived me, they hastened on, trying to get away. I
shouted three times to them to stop, but they paid no heed
to my words, so that I unslung my rifle and would have
shot at them had the threat alone not been sufficient to
make them reflect. They halted, and when I got near
enough I claimed my two yaks back. They refused to give
them up. They said they were twelve men, and were not
afraid of one. Dismounted from their ponies, they seemed
ready to go for me.</p>

<p>As I saw them take out a flint and steel to light the fuses of
their matchlocks, I thought I might as well have my innings
first, and, before they could guess at my intention, I applied
a violent blow with the muzzle of my rifle to the stomach of
the man nearest to me. He collapsed, while I administered
another blow to the right temple of another man who held
his matchlock between his legs, and was on the point of
striking his flint and steel to set the tinder on fire. He,
too, staggered and fell clumsily.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Chakzal, chakzal! Chakzal wortzi&eacute;!</i>&quot; (&quot;We salute you,
we salute you! Please listen!&quot;) exclaimed a third brigand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_294" id="Pg_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
with an expression of dismay, and holding up his thumbs,
with his fist closed in sign of approval.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Chakzal</i>,&quot; I replied, shoving a cartridge into the Mannlicher.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Midd&ugrave;, midd&ugrave;!</i>&quot; (&quot;No, no!&quot;) they entreated, promptly
laying down their weapons.</p>

<p>I purchased from these men about thirty pounds of
<i>tsamba</i> and eight of butter, and got one of them to carry
this to my camp, while I, without further trouble, recovered
my yaks and drove them back to where Chanden
Sing and Mansing were busy lighting a fire to make
some tea.</p>

<h5>Travelling Tibetans&mdash;Over a high pass&mdash;A friendly meeting&mdash;A
proffered banquet&mdash;Ascent to 20,000 feet&mdash;Looking for the
Gunkyo Lake&mdash;Surprised by a phantom army.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Towards</span> noon, when our things had got almost dry in the
warm sun, the sky became overclouded, and it again began
to rain heavily. I was rather doubtful as to whether I should
go over a pass some miles off to 93&deg; (b.m.), or should follow
the course of the river and skirt the foot of the mountains.
We saw a large number of Tibetans travelling in the opposite
direction to ours, and they all seemed much terrified
when we approached them. We obtained from them a
few more pounds of food, but they refused to sell us any
sheep, of which they had thousands. I decided to attempt
the first-mentioned route and, making our way first over
a continuation of the flat plateau, then over undulating,
ground, we came to two lakelets, at the foot of the pass
in question. The ascent was comparatively gentle, over
snow, and we followed the river descending from the top.
About half-way up, on looking back, we saw eight soldiers
galloping toward us. We waited for them; and as soon as
they came up to us, they went through the usual servile
salutations, depositing their arms on the ground to show that
they had no intention of fighting. A long friendly palaver
followed, the Tibetans professing their friendship for us and
their willingness to help us to get on in any way in their
power. This was rather too good to be true, and I suspected
treachery, all the more so when they pressed and
entreated us to go back to their tents, where they wished us
to remain as their highly-honoured guests, and where we
should have all the luxuries that human mind can conceive
showered upon us. On further specification, these were
found to consist of presents of <i>chura</i>, cheese, butter, yak
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_296" id="Pg_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>
milk, and <i>tsamba</i>, and they said they would sell us ponies
if we required them. The description was too glowing;
so, taking all things into consideration, and allowing for
the inaccuracy of speech of my interlocutors as well as
of Tibetans in general, I thanked them from the bottom
of my heart and answered that I preferred to continue my
way and bear my present sufferings.</p>

<p>They perceived that I was not easy to catch, and, if anything,
they respected me the more for it. In fact they
could not disguise their amazement at my having got so
far with only two men. When I had given my visitors some
little present, we parted at last, in a very friendly manner.</p>

<p>We climbed up to the pass (18,480 feet), and before us on
the other side found a large stretch of flat land, some two
thousand feet lower. I could see a lake, which I took to be
the Gunkyo. Nevertheless, to make certain of it, I left my
men and yaks on the pass and went to reconnoitre from a
peak 19,000 feet high, N.E. of us. There was much snow
and the ascent was difficult and tedious. When I got to the
top another higher peak barred the view in front of me, so
descending first and then ascending again, I climbed this
second summit, finally reaching an elevation of 20,000 feet,
and obtaining a good bird's-eye view of the country all
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_297" id="Pg_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
round. There was a long snowy range to the North, and,
directly under it, what I imagined to be a stretch of water,
judging from the mist and clouds forming above it, and
from the grass on the lower portion of the mountains.</p>

<p>A hill range stood in my way, just high enough to conceal
the lake behind it. I rejoined my men and we continued
our march down the other side of the pass, sinking in deep,
soft snow. We pitched our tent at a spot about five hundred
feet higher than the plain below us, in a gorge formed by
the two mountain sides coming close together. Notwithstanding
that I was now quite accustomed to great altitudes,
the ascent to 20,000 feet had caused a certain exhaustion,
and I should have been glad of a good night's rest.</p>

<p>Mansing and Chanden Sing, having eaten some food,
slept soundly, but I felt very depressed. I had a peculiar
sense of unrest and of some evil coming to us during the
night.</p>

<p>We were all three under our little tent, when I began to
fancy there was some one outside. I do not know why the
thought entered my head, for I heard no noise, but all the
same I felt I must see and satisfy my curiosity. I peeped
out of the tent with my rifle in hand, and saw a number of
black figures cautiously crawling towards us. In a moment
I was outside on my bare feet, running towards them and
shouting at the top of my voice, &quot;<i>Pila tedau tedang!</i>&quot;
(&quot;Look out, look out!&quot;) which caused a stampede among
our ghostlike visitors. There were, apparently, numbers of
them hidden behind rocks, for when the panic seized them,
the number of runaways was double or even treble that of
the phantoms I had at first seen approaching. At one
moment there seemed to be black ghosts springing out
from everywhere, only, more solid than ghosts, they made
a dreadful noise with their heavy boots as they ran in
confusion down the steep descent and through the gorge.
They turned sharply round the hill at the bottom and
disappeared.</p>

<p>When I crawled inside the tent again Chanden Sing and
Mansing, wrapped head and all in their blankets, were still
snoring!</p>

<h5>A sleepless night&mdash;Watching our enemy&mdash;A picturesque sight&mdash;A
messenger&mdash;Soldiers from Lhassa&mdash;Taken for a Kashmeree&mdash;The
Gunkyo Lake.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Naturally</span> I passed a sleepless night after that, fearing
that the unwelcome visitors might return. We speculated
much as to how the Tibetans had found us, and we could
not help surmising that our friends of the previous afternoon
must have put them on our track. However, such
was the inconceivable cowardice shown on every occasion
by the Tibetans, that we got to attach no importance
to these incidents, and not only did they not inspire us
with fear, but they even ceased to excite or disturb us
much.</p>

<p>We went on as usual, descending to the plain, and when
we had got half-way across it, I scoured the hills all round
with my telescope to see if I could discern traces of our
pusillanimous foes.</p>

<p>&quot;There they are,&quot; cried Chanden Sing, who had the
most wonderful eyesight of any man I have known, as he
pointed at the summit of a hill where, among the rocks,
several heads could be seen peeping. We went on without
taking further notice of them, and then they came out of
their hiding-place, and we saw them descending the hill in
a long line, leading their ponies. On reaching the plain
they mounted their steeds and came full gallop towards us.
They were quite a picturesque sight in their dark-red coats
or brown and yellow skin robes and their vari-coloured caps.
Some wore bright red coats with gold braiding, and Chinese
caps. These were officers. The soldiers' matchlocks, to
the rests of which red and white flags were attached, gave a
touch of colour to the otherwise dreary scenery of barren
hills and snow, and the tinkling of the horse-bells enlivened</p>

the monotony of these silent, inhospitable regions. They
dismounted some three hundred yards from us, and one old
man, throwing aside his matchlock and sword in a theatrical
fashion, walked unsteadily towards us. We received him
kindly, and he afforded us great amusement, for in his way
he was a strange character.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/300.jpg">

<p class="figcenter">&quot;I am only a Messenger&quot;</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>&quot;I am only a messenger,&quot; he hastened to state, &quot;and
therefore do not pour your anger upon me if I speak to
you. I only convey the words of my officers, who do not
dare to come for fear of being injured. News has been
received at Lhassa, from whence we have come, that a
<i>Plenki</i> (an Englishman) with many men is in Tibet, and can
be found nowhere. We have been sent to capture him. Are
you one of his advance guard?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No,&quot; I replied drily. &quot;I suppose that you have taken
several months to come from Lhassa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh no! Our ponies are good,&quot; he answered; &quot;and we
have come quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Chik, ni, sum, shi, nga, do, diu, ghieh, gu, chu, chuck
chick, chuck ni</i>,&quot; the Tibetan counted up to twelve, frowning
and keeping his head inclined towards the right as if to
collect his thoughts, at the same time holding up his hand,
with the thumb folded against the palm, and turning down
a finger as he called each number. The thumbs are never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_301" id="Pg_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
used in counting. &quot;<i>Lum chuck ni niman!</i>&quot; &quot;Twelve
days,&quot; said he, &quot;have we been on the road. We have
orders not to return till we have captured the <i>Plenki</i>. And
you?&quot; asked he inquisitively, &quot;how long have you taken to
come from Ladak?&quot;</p>

<p>He said that he could see by my face that I was a
Kashmeree, I being probably so burnt and dirty that it was
hard to distinguish me from a native. The old man
cross-examined me to find out whether I was a <i>pundit</i> sent
by the Indian Government to survey the country, and
asked me why I had discarded my native clothes for <i>Plenki</i>
(European) ones. He over and over again inquired whether
I was not one of the <i>Plenki's</i> party.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Keran ga naddo ung?</i>&quot; (&quot;Where are you going?&quot;) he
queried.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Nhgarang no koroun Lama jehlhuong.</i>&quot; (&quot;I am a pilgrim,&quot;
I replied, &quot;going to visit monasteries.&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Keran mi japod&ugrave;.</i>&quot; (&quot;You are a good man.&quot;)</p>

<p>He offered to show me the way to the Gunkyo Lake, and
was so pressing that I accepted. However, when I saw
the 200 soldiers mount and follow us, I remonstrated with
him, saying that if we were to be friends we did not need an
army to escort us.</p>

<p>&quot;If you are our friend, you can come alone, and we will
not injure you,&quot; I gave him to understand; &quot;but if you are
our enemy we will fight you and your army here at once,
and we will save you the trouble of coming on.&quot;</p>

<p>The Tibetan, confused and hesitating, went to confabulate
with his men, and returned some time after with eight
of them, while the bulk of his force galloped away in the
opposite direction.</p>

<p>We went across the plain to 355&deg; (b.m.), until we came to
a hill range, which we crossed over a pass 17,450 feet high.
Then, altering our course to 56&deg; 30&#8242;, we descended and
ascended several hills, and at last found ourselves in the
grassy sheltered valley of the large Gunkyo Lake, extending
from South-East to North-West. With a temperature of
68&deg; (Fahr.) the water in hypsometrical apparatus boiled
at 183&deg; 3&frac12;&#8242; at 8.30 in the evening. The lake was of extraordinary
beauty, with the high snowy Gangri mountains
rising almost sheer from its waters, and on the
southern side lofty hills forming a background wild and
picturesque, but barren and desolate beyond all words. At
the other end of the lake, to the North-West, were lower
mountains skirting the water.</p>

<p>We encamped at 16,455 feet, and the soldiers pitched
their tent some fifty yards away.</p>

<h5>In pleasant company&mdash;Unpopularity of the Lamas&mdash;Soldiers&mdash;Towards
the Maium Pass&mdash;Grass&mdash;Threats&mdash;Puzzled
Tibetans&mdash;The Maium Pass&mdash;Obos.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the evening the Tibetans came over to my camp
and made themselves useful. They helped us to get fuel,
and brewed tea for me in Tibetan fashion. They seemed
decent fellows, although sly if you like. They professed
to hate the Lamas, the rulers of the country, to whom
they took special pleasure in applying names hardly
repeatable in these pages. According to them, the Lamas
had all the money that came into the country, and no one
but themselves was allowed to have any. They were not
particular as to the means used to obtain their aim; they
were cruel and unjust. Every man in Tibet, they said, was
a soldier in case of emergency, and every one a servant of
the Lamas. The soldiers of the standing army received a
certain quantity of <i>tsamba</i>, bricks of tea and butter, and that
was all, no pay being given in cash. Usually, however, they
were given a pony to ride, and when on travelling duty they
had a right to obtain relays of animals at post-stations and
villages, where also they were entitled to claim supplies of
food, saddles, or anything else they required, to last them as
far as the next encampment. The weapons (sword and matchlock)
generally belonged to the men themselves, and
always remained in the family; but occasionally, and
especially in the larger towns, such as Lhassa and Sigatz,
the Lamas provided them: gunpowder and bullets were invariably
supplied by the authorities. The arms were manufactured
mostly in Lhassa and Sigatz. Although the
Tibetans boasted of great accuracy in shooting with their
matchlocks, which had wooden rests to allow the marksman
to take a steady aim, it was never my pleasure to see even</p>

the champion shots in the country hit the mark. It is true
that, for sporting purposes and for economy's
sake, the Tibetan soldier hardly ever used lead
bullets or shot, but preferred to fill his barrel
with pebbles, which were scarcely calculated to
improve the bore of the weapon. Furthermore,
gunpowder was so scarce that it was but very
seldom they had a chance
of practising.</p>

<p>At sunrise the view of Gunkyo was magnificent, with the snow-covered
mountains tinted gold and red, and reflected in their minutest details in
the still waters of the lake. We loaded our yaks, the Tibetans giving us
a helping hand, and started towards the Maium Pass, following a general
course of 109&deg; up the river, which throws itself into the Gunkyo
Lake.</p>

<p>The valley was very narrow, and ran in continuous zigzags; but although
the altitude was great, there was abundance of grass, and the green was
quite refreshing to the eyes, tired as we were of snow and reddish barren
mountains and desert-like stretches of land. We came to a basin where, on
the opposite bank of the stream, was a large Tibetan camping-ground with
a high wall of stones. Behind it I could see smoke rising, which made me
suspect that there were people concealed there.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_305" id="Pg_305"></a>[<a href="./images/305.png">305</a>]</span>Our Tibetan friends asked what we were going to do, and
begged me to stop there to talk and drink tea. I said I had
had quite enough of both, and would proceed.</p>

<p>&quot;If you go on we will kill you,&quot; said one of the soldiers,
getting into a temper, and taking advantage of our politeness
towards him and his mates.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Nga samgi ganta indah</i>&quot; (&quot;If you please&quot;), I answered
with studied courtesy.</p>

<p>&quot;If you go another step, we will cut off your head, or you
will have to cut off ours,&quot; cried two or three others, stretching
their bare necks towards me.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Taptih midd&ugrave;</i>&quot; (&quot;I have not got a small knife&quot;), I
replied, quite seriously, and with assumed disappointment,
twirling my hand in the air in Tibetan fashion.</p>

<p>The Tibetans did not know what to make of me, and
when I moved towards the pass, on which hundreds of
flying prayers flapped in the wind, after politely bidding
them good-bye with tongue out, and waving both my hands
palms upwards in front of my forehead in the most
approved Tibetan style, they took off their caps and humbly
saluted us by going down on their knees and putting their
heads close to the ground.</p>

<p>We crossed the plain, and slowly wended our way up the
pass. Near the top we came to a track, the highway from
Ladak to Lhassa <i>vi&acirc;</i> Gartok, along the northern side of the
Rakstal, Mansarowar and Gunkyo Lakes. On the pass itself
were planted several poles connected by means of ropes,
from which flying prayers waved gaily in the breeze. <i>Obos</i>,
or mounds of stones, had also been erected here. The slabs
were usually white, and bore in many instances the inscription
&quot;<i>Omne mani padme hun</i>.&quot; Yak skulls and horns, as
well as those of goats and sheep, were laid by the side of
these Obos, the same words being engraved on the bone
and stained red with the blood of the animal killed.</p>

<p>These sacrifices are offered by Tibetans when crossing a
high pass, especially if there is a Lama close at hand to
commemorate the event. The meat of the animal killed is
eaten by the people present, and, if the party is a large one,
dancing and singing follow the feast. As I have already
remarked, these Obos are found all over the country; they
indicate the points marking the passes or summits of hills,
and no Tibetan ever goes by one of them without depositing
on it a white stone to appease the possible wrath of
their God.</p>

<h5>The Maium Pass&mdash;Into the Yutzang province&mdash;Its capital&mdash;The
Doktol province&mdash;Orders disregarded&mdash;The sources of
the Brahmaputra&mdash;Change in the climate&mdash;The valley of the
Brahmaputra&mdash;Running risks.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Maium Pass (17,500 feet), to which from where I
started no Englishman had ever penetrated, is a great landmark
in Tibet, for not only does one of the sources of
the great Tsangpu, or Brahmaputra River, rise on its S.E.
slopes, but it also separates the immense provinces of Nari-Khorsum
(extending West of the Maium Pass and comprising
the mountainous and lacustrine region as far as Ladak)
from the Yutzang, the central province of Tibet, stretching
East of the pass along the valley of the Brahmaputra
and having Lhassa for its capital. The word <i>Yu</i> in Tibetan
means &quot;middle,&quot; and it is applied to this province, as it
occupies the centre of Tibet. To the North of the Maium
lies the Doktol province.</p>

<p>I had taken a reconnoitring trip to another pass to the
N.E. of us, and had just returned to my men on the Maium
Pass, when several of the Tibetan soldiers we had left behind
rode up towards us. We waited for them, and their leader,
pointing at the valley beyond the pass, cried: &quot;That yonder
is the Lhassa territory and we forbid you to enter it.&quot;</p>

<p>I took no notice of his protest, and driving before me the
two yaks I stepped into the most sacred of all the sacred
provinces, &quot;the ground of God.&quot;</p>

<p>We descended quickly on the Eastern side of the pass,
while the soldiers, aghast, remained watching us from
above, themselves a most picturesque sight as they stood
among the Obos against the sky-line, with the sunlight
shining on their jewelled swords and the gay red flags of
their matchlocks, while over their heads strings of flying
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_307" id="Pg_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
prayers waved in the wind. Having watched us for a little
while, they disappeared.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<img src="./images/307_th.jpg" alt="Source of the Brahmaputra" title="Source of the Brahmaputra" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Source of the Brahmaputra</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>A little rivulet, hardly six inches wide, descended among
stones in the centre of the valley we were following, and
was soon swollen by other rivulets from melting snows on
the mountains to either side. This was one source<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> of the
great Brahmaputra, one of the largest rivers of the world.
I must confess that I felt somewhat proud to be the first
European who had ever reached these sources, and there
was a certain childish delight in standing over this sacred
stream which, of such immense width lower down, could
here be spanned by a man standing with legs slightly apart.
We drank of its waters at the spot where it had its birth, and
then, following a marked track to 125&deg; (b.m.), we continued
our descent on a gentle incline along a grassy valley. The
change in the climate between the West and South-east
sides of the Maium Pass was extraordinary. On the Western
side we had nothing but violent storms of hail, rain and
snow, the dampness in the air rendering the atmosphere cold
even during the day. The soil was unusually marshy, and
very little fuel or grass could be found. The moment the
pass was crossed we were in a mild, pleasant climate, with a
lovely deep blue sky over us and plenty of grass for the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_308" id="Pg_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
yaks, as well as low shrubs for our fires; so that, after all our
sufferings and privations, we felt that we had indeed entered
the land of God. Notwithstanding that I expected great
trouble sooner or later, I was not at all sorry I had disobeyed
the soldiers' orders and had marched straight into the
forbidden territory&mdash;it was a kind of wild satisfaction at
doing that which is forbidden.</p>

<p>The Brahmaputra received three small snow-fed tributaries
descending rapidly from the steep mountains on
either side of us; and where the main stream turned sharply
to 170&deg;, a fourth and important tributary, carrying a very
large volume of water, came down to it through a gorge
from 20&deg; (b.m.).</p>

<p>We encamped near the junction of these rivers, on the
right bank of the main stream, at an altitude of 16,620 feet.
From the Maium Pass a continuation of the Gangri chain of
mountains runs first in a South-easterly direction, then due
East, taking a line almost parallel to the higher Southern range
of the Himahlyas, and forming a vast plain intersected by
the Brahmaputra. On the Southern side of the river can be
seen minor hill ranges between the river course and the big
range with its majestic snowy peaks and beautiful glaciers.
This Northern range keeps an almost parallel line to
the greater range southward; and, though no peaks of
very considerable elevation are to be found along it, yet
it is of geographical importance, as its Southern slopes
form the Northern watershed of the holy river as far as
Lhassa.</p>

<p>The valley enclosed between these two parallel ranges is
the most thickly populated valley in Tibet. Grass is abundant,
and fuel easily obtainable, and therefore thousands of yaks,
sheep, and goats can be seen grazing near the many Tibetan
camps along the Brahmaputra and its principal tributaries.
The trade route taken by the caravans from Ladak to Lhassa
follows this valley; and, as I came to Tibet to see and study
the Tibetans, I thought that, although I might run greater
risks, I could in no part of the country accomplish my object
better than by going along this thickly populated track.</p>

<h5>Expecting trouble&mdash;Along the Brahmaputra&mdash;A thunderstorm&mdash;A
dilemma&mdash;A dangerous river&mdash;Swamped&mdash;Saved&mdash;Night
disturbers&mdash;A new friend.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> slept very little, as we expected the soldiers to attack us
during the night to try and stop our progress, but all was
quiet and nothing happened; our yaks, however, managed
to get loose, and we had some difficulty in recovering them
in the morning, for they had swum across the stream, and
had gone about a mile from camp on the other side.</p>

<p>The night had been very cold, the thermometer dropping
as low as 32&frac12;&deg;. We did not pitch our little tent, in case of
emergencies, and we were tired and cold after the long
march of the previous day. There was a South-westerly
breeze blowing and I found it hard to have to cross the
river, chase the yaks and bring them back to camp. Then,
exhausted as we were, we had in addition to go through
the daily routine of loading them. We followed the right
bank of the stream to bearings 170&deg; (m.), then to 142&deg; 30&#8242;
(b.m.), where it wound in and out between barren hills,
subsequently flowing through a grassy valley three-quarters
of a mile wide and a mile and a half long. It then went
through a narrow passage to 17&deg; 30&#8242; (b.m.) and turned
to 103&deg; and farther to 142&deg; through an undulating grassy
valley two miles wide, in crossing which we were caught in
a terrific thunderstorm, with hail and rain. This was indeed
an annoying experience, for we were now before a very
large tributary of the Brahmaputra, and the stream was so
swollen, rapid and deep that I was much puzzled as to how
to take my men across: they could not swim, and the water
was so cold that a dip in it would give any one a severe
shock. However, there was no time to be lost, for the
river was visibly rising, and as the storm was getting worse,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_310" id="Pg_310"></a>[<a href="./images/310.png">310</a>]</span>
difficulties would only increase every moment. We took off
every stitch of clothing and fastened our garments, with our
rifles, &amp;c., on the pack-saddles of the yaks, which we sent
into the water. They are good swimmers, and though the
current carried them over a hundred yards down stream,
we saw them with satisfaction scramble out of the water
on to the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the faith that
Chanden Sing and Mansing had in my swimming, they really
thought that their last hour had come when I took each by
the hand and asked them to follow me into the stream.
Hardly had we gone twelve yards when the inevitable took
place. We were all three swept away, and Chanden Sing and
Mansing in their panic clung tight to my arms and dragged
me under water. Though I swam my hardest with my legs,
we continually came to the surface and then sank again,
owing to the dead weight of my helpless mates. But
at last, after a desperate struggle, the current washed us
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_311" id="Pg_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>
on to the opposite side, where we found our feet, and
were soon able to scramble out of the treacherous river.
We were some two hundred yards down stream from the
spot at which we had entered the river, and such was the
quantity of muddy water we had swallowed that we all
three became sick. This left us much exhausted, and,
as the storm showed no signs of abating, we encamped
(16,320 feet) there and then on the left bank of the stream.
Though we sadly needed some warm food, there was, of
course, no possibility of lighting a fire. A piece of chocolate
was all I had that night, and my men preferred to eat
nothing rather than break their caste by eating my food.</p>

<p>We were asleep under our little tent, the hour being
about eleven, when there was a noise outside as of voices
and people stumbling against stones. I was out in a
moment with my rifle, and shouted the usual &quot;<i>Palad&ograve;</i>&quot;
(&quot;Go away&quot;), in answer to which, though I could see
nothing owing to the darkness, I heard several stones flung
from slings whizzing past me. One of these hit the tent,
and a dog barked furiously. I fired a shot in the air, which
had the good effect of producing a hasty retreat of our
enemies, whoever they were. The dog, however, would not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_312" id="Pg_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>
go. He remained outside barking all night, and it was only
in the morning, when I gave him some food and caressed
him in Tibetan fashion, with the usual words of endearment,
&quot;<i>Chochu, Chochu</i>,&quot; that our four-footed foe became
friendly, rubbing himself against my legs as if he had
known me all his life, and taking a particular fancy to Mansing,
by whose side he lay down. From that day he never
left our camp, and followed us everywhere, until harder times
came upon us.</p>

<h5>Leaving the course of the river&mdash;A pass&mdash;An arid plain&mdash;More
vanishing soldiers&mdash;Another river&mdash;A <i>mani</i> wall&mdash;<i>Mirage?</i>&mdash;A
large Tibetan encampment&mdash;The chain of mountains North
of us.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> river was turning too much towards the South, so I
decided to abandon it and strike across country, especially
as there were faint signs of a track leading over a pass to
110&deg; (b.m.) from camp. I followed this track, and along it
I distinguished marks of hundreds of ponies' hoofs, now
almost entirely washed away. This was evidently the way
taken by the soldiers we had encountered on the other side
of the Maium Pass.</p>

<p>Having risen over the col 17,750 feet, we saw before us
an extensive valley with barren hills scattered over it. To
the South we observed a large plain some ten miles wide,
with snowy peaks rising on the farther side. In front was a
hill projecting into the plain, on which stood a <i>mani</i> wall;
and this latter discovery made me feel quite confident that
I was on the high road to Lhassa. About eight miles off to
the NNW. were high snowy peaks, and as we went farther
we found a lofty mountain range, with still higher peaks,
three miles behind it. We had travelled half-way across the
waterless plain, when we noticed a number of soldiers' heads
and matchlocks popping in and out from behind a distant
hill. After a while they came out in numbers to observe
our movements, then retired again behind the hill. We proceeded,
but when we were still half a mile from them they
abandoned their hiding-place, and galloped away before us,
raising clouds of dust. From a hill 16,200 feet, over which
the track crossed, we perceived a group of very high snowy
peaks about eight miles distant. Between them and us
stood a range of hills cut by a valley, along which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_314" id="Pg_314"></a>[<a href="./images/314.png">314</a>]</span>
flowed a river carrying a large volume of water. This
we followed to 126&deg; (b.m.), and having found a suitable
fording-place, we crossed over at a spot where the stream
was twenty-five yards across, and the water reached up to
our waists. We found here another <i>mani</i> wall with large
inscriptions on stones, and as the wind was very high and
cutting, we made use of it to shelter us. Within the angle
comprised between bearings 240&deg; and 120&deg; (b.m.) we could
observe a very high, snowy mountain range in the distance
(the great Himahlyan chain), and lower hill ranges even as
near as three miles from camp. The river we had just
crossed flowed into the Brahmaputra, and we were now at
an elevation of 15,700 feet. We saw plainly at sunset a
number of black tents before us at bearings 120&deg;; we
calculated them to be two miles distant. We counted
about sixty, as well as hundreds of black yaks.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>At sunrise the next morning, much to our surprise, they
had all vanished; nor, on marching in the direction where
we had seen them the previous night, were we able to
find traces of them. It seemed as if it must have been
<i>mirage</i>. Eventually, however, some fourteen miles away,
across a grassy plain bounded to the North-East by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_315" id="Pg_315"></a>[<a href="./images/315.png">315</a>]</span>
the range extending from North-West to South-East,
and with lofty snowy peaks at 72&deg; some five miles off,
we came upon a very large Tibetan encampment of over
eighty black tents at an altitude of 15,650 feet. They were
pitched on the banks of another tributary of the Brahmaputra,
which, after describing a great curve in the plain, passed
West of the encampment. Five miles off, in the arc of
circle described from 310&deg; to 70&deg; (b.m.), stood the chain of
mountains which I had observed all along; but here the
elevations of its peaks became gradually lower and lower,
so much so that the name of &quot;hill range&quot; would be more
appropriate to it than that of &quot;mountain chain.&quot; Behind it,
however, towered loftier peaks again with their snowy caps.</p>

<h5>A commotion&mdash;An invitation declined&mdash;The tents&mdash;Delicacies&mdash;The
<i>Chokseh</i>.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> wanted food, and so made boldly for the encampment.
Our approach caused a great commotion, and yaks and sheep
were hastily driven away before us, while men and women
rushed in and out of their tents, apparently in a state of much
excitement. Eight or ten men reluctantly came forward
and entreated us to go inside a large tent. They said they
wished to speak to us, and offered us tea. I would
not accept their invitation, distrusting them, but went on
across the encampment, halting some three hundred yards
beyond it. Chanden Sing and I proceeded afterwards
on a round of calls at all the tents, trying to purchase food
and also to show that, if we had declined to enter a particular
tent, it was not on account of fear, but because we
did not want to be caught in a trap. Our visit to the
different <i>golingchos</i> or <i>gurr</i> (tents) was interesting enough.
The tents themselves were very cleverly constructed, and
admirably adapted to the country in which they were used;
and the various articles of furniture inside attracted my
curiosity. The tents, black in colour, were woven of yaks'
hair, the natural greasiness of which made them quite
waterproof. They consisted of two separate pieces of this
thick material, supported by two poles at each end, and
there was an oblong aperture above in the upper part of the
tent, through which the smoke could escape. The base of
the larger tents was hexagonal in shape: the roof, generally
at a height of six or seven feet above the ground, was kept
very tightly stretched by means of long ropes passing over
high poles and pegged to the ground. Wooden and iron
pegs were used for this purpose, and many were required
to keep the tent close to the ground all round, so as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_317" id="Pg_317"></a>[<a href="./images/317.png">317</a>]</span>
to protect its inmates from the cutting winds of the great
plateau. Long poles, as a rule numbering four, with
white flying prayers, could be seen outside each tent,
or one to each point of the compass, the East being
taken for a starting-point. Around the interior of the
larger tents there was a mud wall from two to three
feet high, for the purpose of further protection against wind,
rain and snow. These walls were sometimes constructed of
dried dung, which, as time went on, was used for fuel.
There were two apertures, one at either end of the tent;
that facing the wind being always kept closed by means of
loops and wooden bolts.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Tibetan is a born nomad, and shifts his dwelling with
the seasons, or wherever he can find pasture for his yaks
and sheep; but, though he has no fixed abode, he knows
how to make himself comfortable, and he carries with him
all that he requires. Thus, for instance, in the centre of
his tent, he begins by making himself a <i>goling</i>, or fireplace
of mud and stone, some three feet high and four or five
long, by one and a half wide, with two, three, or more side
ventilators and draught-holes. By this ingenious contrivance
he manages to increase the combustion of the dried
dung, the most trying fuel from which to get a flame. On
the top of this stove a suitable place is made to fit the several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_318" id="Pg_318"></a>[<a href="./images/318.png">318</a>]</span>
<i>raksangs</i>, or large brass pots and bowls, in which the brick
tea, having been duly pounded in a stone or wooden
mortar, is boiled and stirred with a long brass spoon.
A portable iron stand is generally to be seen somewhere in
the tent, upon which the hot vessels are placed, as they are
removed from the fire. Close to these is the <i>toxzum</i> or
<i>dongbo</i>, a cylindrical wooden churn, with a lid through which
a piston passes. This is used for mixing the
tea with butter and salt, in the way I have
described as also adopted by the Jogpas.</p>

<img src="./images/318_th.jpg" alt="A Dongbo or Tea Churn" title="A Dongbo or Tea Churn" /></a><br />
A Dongbo or Tea Churn</div>
<p>The wooden cups or bowls used by the Tibetans are called <i>puku, fruh</i>, or
<i>cariel</i>, and in them <i>tsamba</i> is also eaten after tea has been poured on
it, and the mixture worked into a paste by means of more or less dirty
fingers. Often extra lumps of butter are mixed with this paste, and even
bits of <i>chura</i> (cheese). The richer people (officials) indulge in flour
and rice, which they import from India and China, and in <i>kassur</i>, or
dried fruit (namely, dates and apricots) of inferior quality. The rice is
boiled into a kind of soup called the <i>tukpa</i>, a great luxury only
indulged in on grand occasions, when such other cherished delicacies as
<i>gimakara</i> (sugar) and <i>shelkara</i> (lump white sugar) are also eaten. The
Tibetans are very fond of meat, though few can afford such an
extravagance. Wild game, yak and sheep are considered excellent food, and
the meat and bone cut in pieces are boiled in a cauldron with lavish
quantities of salt and pepper. The several people in a tent dip their
hands into the pot, and having picked up suitable pieces, tug at them
with their teeth and fingers, grinding even the bone, meat eaten without
bone being supposed to be difficult to digest.</p>

<p>The Tibetan tents are usually furnished with a few <i>tildih</i>
(rough sitting-mats) round the fireplace, and near the entrance
of the tent stands a <i>dahlo</i>, or basket, in which the
dung is stored as collected. These <i>dahlos</i>, used in couples,
are very convenient for tying to pack-saddles, for which
purpose they are specially designed. Along the walls of the
tent are the <i>tsamgo</i> or bags of <i>tsamba</i>, and the <i>dongmo</i> or
butter-pots, and among masses of sheepskins and blankets
can be seen the little wooden chests in which the store of
butter is kept under lock and key.</p></div>

The first thing that strikes the eye on entering a Tibetan
tent is the <i>chokseh</i> or table, upon which are lights and
brass bowls containing offerings to the <i>Chogan</i>, the gilt
god to whom the occupiers of the <i>gurr</i> (tent) address their
morning and evening prayers. Prayer-wheels and strings
of beads are plentiful, and lashed upright to the poles are
the long matchlocks belonging to the men, their tall props
projecting well out of the aperture in the roof of the tent.
Spears are kept in a similar manner, but the swords and
smaller knives are carried about the person all day, and laid
on the ground by the side of their owners at night.</p>

<h5>Refusal to sell food&mdash;Women&mdash;Their looks and characteristics&mdash;The
<i>Tchukti</i>&mdash;A Lhassa lady.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> inhabitants of this encampment were polite and talkative.
Notwithstanding their refusal to sell us food on the plea
that they had none even for themselves, their friendliness
was so much beyond my expectation that I at first feared
treachery. However, treachery or not, I thought that while
I was there I had better see and learn as much as I could.
Women and men formed a ring round us, and the fair sex
seemed less shy than the stronger in answering questions.
I was particularly struck, not only in this encampment but
in all the others, by the small number of women to be seen
in Tibet. This is not because they are kept in seclusion; on
the contrary, the ladies of the Forbidden Land seem to have
it all their own way. They are actually in an enormous
minority, the proportion being, at a rough guess, backed by
the wise words of a friendly Lama, from fifteen to twenty
males to each female in the population; nevertheless, the
fair sex in Hundes manages to rule the male majority,
playing thereby constantly into the hands of the Lamas.</p>

<p>The Tibetan female, whether she be a lady, a shepherdess,
or a brigandess, cannot be said to be prepossessing. In
fact, it was not my luck to see a single good-looking
woman in the country, although I naturally saw women who
were less ugly than others. Anyhow, with the accumulated
filth that from birth is undisturbed by soap, scrubbing
or bathing; with nose, cheeks and forehead smeared with
black ointment to prevent the skin cracking in the wind;
and with the unpleasant odour that emanates from never-changed
clothes, the Tibetan woman is, at her best, repulsive
to European taste. After one has overcome one's first
disgust she yet has, at a distance, a certain charm of her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_322" id="Pg_322"></a>[<a href="./images/322.png">322</a>]</span>
own. She walks well, for she is accustomed to carry heavy
weights on her head; and her skull would be well-set on
her shoulders were it not that the neck is usually too short
and thick to be graceful. Her body and limbs possess
great muscular strength and are well developed, but generally
lack stability, and her breasts are flabby and pendent&mdash;facts
due, no doubt, to sexual abuse. She is generally of heavy
frame, and rather inclined to stoutness. Her hands and
feet show power and rude strength, but no dexterity or suppleness
is noticeable in her fingers, and she has therefore
no ability for very fine or delicate work.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The Tibetan woman is, nevertheless, far superior to the
Tibetan man. She possesses a better heart, more pluck,
and a finer character than he does. Time after time, when
the males, timid beyond all conception, ran away at our
approach, the women remained in charge of the tents, and,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_324" id="Pg_324"></a>[<a href="./images/324.png">324</a>]</span>
although by no means cool or collected, they very rarely
failed to meet us without some show of dignity.</p>

<p>On the present occasion, when all were friendly, the
women seemed much less shy than the men, and conversed
freely and incessantly. They even prevailed upon their
masters to sell us a little <i>tsamba</i> and butter.</p>

<p>Tibetan women wear trousers and boots like the men, and over them they
have a long gown, either yellow or blue, reaching down to their feet.
Their head-dress is curious, the hair being carefully parted in the
middle, and plastered with melted butter over the scalp as far down as
the ears; then it is plaited all round in innumerable little tresses, to
which is fastened the <i>Tchukti</i>, three strips of heavy red and blue cloth
joined together by cross bands ornamented with coral and malachite beads,
silver coins and bells, and reaching from the shoulders down to the
heels.</p>

<p>They seemed very proud of this ornamentation, and displayed much coquetry
in attracting our notice to it. Wealthier women in Tibet have quite a
small fortune hanging down their backs, for all the money or valuables
earned or saved are sewn on to the <i>Tchukti</i>. To the lower end of the
<i>Tchukti</i> one, two or three rows of small brass or silver bells are
attached, and therefore the approach of the Tibetan dames is announced by

tinkling of their bells, a quaint custom, the origin of which
they could not explain to me, beyond saying that it was
pretty and that they liked it.</p>

<p>The illustration that I give here of a travelling Tibetan
lady from Lhassa was taken at Tucker. She wore her hair,
of abnormal length and beauty, in one huge tress, and
round her head, like an aureole, was a circular wooden
ornament, on the outer part of which were fastened beads of
coral, glass and malachite. The arrangement was so heavy
that, though it fitted the head well, it had to be supported
by means of strings tied to the hair and others passed over
the head. By the side of her head, and hanging by the
ears and hair, were a pair of huge silver earrings inlaid with
malachite, and round her neck three long strings of beads
with silver brooches.</p>

<p>Considerable modifications necessarily occurred in these
garments and ornaments, according to the locality and the
wearer's condition in life, but the general lines of their
clothing were practically everywhere the same. Often a
loose silver chain belt was worn considerably below the
waist, and rings and bracelets were common everywhere.</p>

<h5>Polyandry&mdash;Marriage ceremonies&mdash;Jealousy&mdash;Divorce&mdash;Identification
of children&mdash;Courtship&mdash;Illegitimacy&mdash;Adultery.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the Tibetans legally recognise polyandry and polygamy
is well known. Very little, however, has hitherto
transpired as to the actual form of these marital customs,
so that the details which follow, startling as they may
seem when regarded from a Western standpoint, will be
found not without interest.</p>

<p>First of all, I may say that there is not such a thing known
in Tibet as a standard of morality amongst unmarried
women of the middle classes; and, therefore, from a Tibetan
point of view, it is not easy to find an immoral woman.
Notwithstanding this apparently irregular state of affairs,
the women's behaviour is better than might be expected.
Like the Shoka girls, they possess a wonderful frankness
and simplicity of manner, with a certain reserve which has
its allurements; for the Tibetan swain, often a young man,
being attracted by the charms of a damsel, finds that his
flirtation with her has become an accepted engagement
almost before it has begun, and is compelled, in accordance
with custom, to go, accompanied by his father and mother,
to the tent of the lady of his heart. There he is received
by her relations, who have been previously notified of the
intended call, and are found seated on rugs and mats awaiting
the arrival of their guests.</p>

<p>After the usual courtesies and salutations, the young
man's father asks, on behalf of his son, for the young
lady's hand; and, if the answer is favourable, the suitor
places a square lump of yak <i>murr</i> (yak butter) on his betrothed's
forehead. She does the same for him, and the
marriage ceremony is then considered over, the buttered
couple being man and wife.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_328" id="Pg_328"></a>[<a href="./images/328.png">328</a>]</span>If there is a temple close by, <i>Katas</i>, food and money are laid before
the images of Buddha and saints, and the parties walk round the inside of
the temple. Should there be no temple at hand, the husband and wife make
the circuit of the nearest hill, or, in default of anything else, the
tent itself, always moving from left to right. This ceremony is repeated
with prayers and sacrifices every day for a fortnight, during which time
libations of wine and general feasting continue, and at the expiration of
which the husband conveys his better half to his tent.</p>

<p>The law of Tibet, though hardly ever obeyed, has strict clauses
regulating the conduct of married men in their marital relations. So long
as the sun is above the horizon, no intercourse is permitted; and certain
periods and seasons of the year, such as the height of summer and the
depth of winter, are also proscribed.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">Woman whose Face is Smeared with Black Ointment</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>A Tibetan girl on marrying does not enter into a nuptial tie with an
individual but with all his family, in the following somewhat complicated
manner. If an eldest son marries an eldest sister, all the sisters of the
bride become his wives. Should he, however, begin by marrying the second
sister, then only the sisters from the second down will be his property.
If the third, all from the third, and so on. At the same time, when the
bridegroom has brothers, they are all regarded as their brother's wife's
husbands, and they one and all cohabit with her, as well as with her
sisters if she has any.</p>

<p>The system is not simple, and certainly not very edifying,
and were it not for the odd <i>savoir faire</i> of the Tibetan woman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_329" id="Pg_329"></a>[<a href="./images/329.png">329</a>]</span>
it would lead to endless jealousies and unpleasantness: owing,
however, largely, no doubt, to the absolute lack of honour or
decency in Tibetan males and females, the arrangement
seems to work as satisfactorily as any other kind of marriage.</p>

<p>I asked what would happen in the case of a man marrying a second sister,
and so acquiring marital rights over all her younger sisters, if another
man came and married her eldest sister. Would all the brides of the first
man become the brides of the second? No, they would not; and the second
man would have to be satisfied with only one wife. However, if the second
sister were left a widow, and her husband had no brothers, then she would
become the property of her eldest sister's husband, and with her all the
other sisters.</p>

<p>It must not be inferred from these strange matrimonial laws that jealousy
is non-existent in Tibet among both men and women; trouble does
occasionally arise in Tibetan house- or tent-holds. As, however, the
Tibetan woman is clever, she generally contrives to arrange things in a
manner conducive to peace. When her husband has several brothers, she
despatches them on different errands in every direction, to look after
yaks or sheep, or to trade. Only one remains and he is for the time being
her husband; then when another returns he has to leave his place and
becomes a bachelor, and so on, till all the brothers have, during the
year, had an equal period of marital life with their single wife.</p>

<p>Divorce is difficult in Tibet and involves endless complications.
I inquired of a Tibetan lady what would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_330" id="Pg_330"></a>[<a href="./images/330.png">330</a>]</span>
she do in case her husband refused to live with her any
longer.</p>

<p>&quot;'Why did you marry me?' I would say to him,&quot; she
exclaimed. &quot;'You found me good, beautiful, wise, clever,
affectionate. Now prove that I am not all this!'&quot;</p>

<p>This modest speech, she thought, would be quite sufficient to bring any
husband back to reason, but all the same a number of Tibetans find it
convenient occasionally to desert their wives, eloping to some distant
province, or over the boundary. This procedure is particularly hard on
the man's brothers, as they all remain the sole property of the abandoned
bride. On the same principle, when a husband dies, the wife is inherited
by his brothers.</p>

<p>A very painful case came before the court of the Jong Pen at Taklakot.
The husband of a Tibetan lady had died, and she, being enamoured of a
handsome youth some twenty years younger than herself, married him. Her
husband's brother, however, came all the way from Lhassa after her and
claimed her as his wife, though he had already a better half and a large

them, the case was heard by the Jong Pen of Taklakot.
The Tibetan law was against her, as, according to it, she
decidedly belonged to her brother-in-law; but money is
stronger than the law in the land of the Lamas.</p>

<p>&quot;For the peace of all, you can arrange things this way,&quot;
was the advice of the Jong Pen. &quot;You can divide your
property, money and goods, into three equal parts: one to
go to the Lamas, one to your husband's brother, and one to
be retained by yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>The woman consented; but, much to her disgust, when
two parts had been paid out and she was hoping for peace,
a question was raised by the Jong Pen as to why she should
even retain one-third of the fortune if she no longer made
part of the deceased man's family? Thus orders were
instantly given that she should be deprived of everything
she possessed.</p>

<p>However, the woman was shrewd enough to deceive the
Jong Pen's officers, for one night, having bundled up her
tent and her goods and chattels, she quietly stepped over
the boundary and placed herself under British protection.</p>

<p>The mode of knowing and identifying children in Tibet is
peculiar. It is not by the child's likeness to his parent, nor
by other reasonable methods, that the offspring is set down
as belonging to one man more than to another, but this is
the mode adopted. Supposing that one married man had
two brothers and several children, the first child belongs to
him; the second to his first brother, and the third to his
second brother, while the fourth would be again the first
man's child.</p>

<p>The rules of courtship are not very strict in Tibet, yet
intercourse with girls is looked upon as illegal, and in
certain cases not only are the parties, if discovered, made
to suffer shame, but certain fines are inflicted on the man,
the most severe of all being that he must present the young
lady with a dress and ornaments. In the case of &quot;gentlefolks&quot;
the question is generally solved to the satisfaction of
everybody by the man marrying the woman, and by his gracefully
presenting &quot;veils of friendship&quot; to all her relations and
friends, together with articles of food; but if by mischance
she should be placed in an awkward position before the
eyes of the world, and the man will not hear of a matrimonial
union, then efforts are made to prevent the birth
of the child alive. If these are not successful, the mother
must be maintained until after the child's birth. In such
cases the illegitimate child remains the man's, and suffers
the usual indignities of illegitimacy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_333" id="Pg_333"></a>[<a href="./images/333.png">333</a>]</span>Sixteen in the case of women, and eighteen or nineteen in
that of men, is regarded as the marriageable age. Motherhood
continues until a fairly advanced age, and I have
seen a woman of forty with a baby only a few months old.
But, as a rule, Tibetan women lose their freshness while still
quite young; and no doubt their custom of polyandry not
only contributes to destroy their looks but also is the chief
cause that limits the population of Tibet.</p>

<p>The Lamas are supposed to live in celibacy, but they
do not always keep to their oath, tempted, no doubt, by
the fact that they themselves invariably go unpunished. If,
on the other hand, in cases of adultery, the culprit be a
layman, he has to pay compensation according to his means
to the husband, the amount being fixed by the parties
concerned and their friends, or by the law if applied for.</p>

<p>In ordinary cases of marital trespass, presents of clothing,
<i>tsamba, chura, guram, kassur</i> (dried fruit) and wine, accompanied
by the never-lacking <i>Kata</i>, are sufficient to allay
the injured husband's anger and to fully compensate him
for any shame suffered.</p>

<p>The only serious punishment inflicted is, however, in the
case of the wife of a high official eloping with a man of low
rank. Then the woman is subjected to flogging as a penalty
for her infidelity, her husband is disgraced, and her lover,
after being subjected to a painful surgical operation, is, if
he survives, expelled from the town or encampment.</p>

<p>High officials, and a few wealthy people who are not
satisfied with one wife, are allowed by the law of the land
to keep as many concubines as their means allow them.</p>

<h5>Tibetan funerals&mdash;Disposal of their dead&mdash;By cremation&mdash;By
water&mdash;Cannibalism&mdash;Strange beliefs&mdash;Revolting barbarity&mdash;Drinking
human blood&mdash;The saints of Tibet.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Tibetan</span> funerals are interesting, but they so closely
resemble those of the Shokas, which I have described at
length, that any detailed account of them would be a mere
repetition of what I have already written.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/334.jpg">
<img src="./images/334_th.jpg" alt="A Young Lama" title="A Young Lama" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">A Young Lama</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>For the disposal of the dead body itself, however, the
Tibetans have curious customs of their own. The most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_335" id="Pg_335"></a>[<a href="./images/335.png">335</a>]</span>
uncommon method, owing to the great scarcity of fuel, is
that of cremation, which is only employed in the case of
wealthy people or Lamas, and is effected in exactly the
same fashion as among the Shokas. Another and more
usual plan is to double up the body, sew it into skins, and
let it be carried away by the current of a stream. But
the commonest method of all is the revolting ceremony
which I now proceed to describe.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/335.jpg">
<img src="./images/335_th.jpg" alt="A Red Lama" title="A Red Lama" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">A Red Lama</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The body of the deceased is borne to the top of a hill,
where the Lamas pronounce certain incantations and
prayers. Then the crowd, after walking seven times round
the body, retire to a certain distance, to allow ravens and
dogs to tear the corpse to pieces. It is considered lucky for
the departed and his family when birds alone devour the
greater portion of the body; dogs and wild animals
come, say the Lamas, when the deceased has sinned during
his life. Anyhow, the almost complete destruction of the
corpse is anxiously watched, and, at an opportune moment,
the Lamas and crowd, turning their praying-wheels, and
muttering the everlasting &quot;<i>Omne mani padme hun</i>,&quot; return
to the body, round which seven more circuits are made,
moving from left to right.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> Then the relatives squat round.
The Lamas sit near the body, and with their daggers cut to
pieces what remains of the flesh. The highest Lama present
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_336" id="Pg_336"></a>[<a href="./images/336.png">336</a>]</span>
eats the first morsel, then, muttering prayers, the other Lamas
partake of it, after which all the relations and friends throw themselves
on the now almost denuded skeleton, scraping off pieces of flesh, which
they devour greedily; and this repast of human flesh continues till the
bones are dry and clean!</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/336-1.jpg">
<img src="./images/336-1_th.jpg" alt="Cup made of Human Skull" title="Cup made of Human Skull" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Cup made of Human Skull</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The idea of this ghastly ceremony is that the spirit of the departed, of
whom you have swallowed a piece, will for ever keep on friendly terms
with you. When birds and dogs do not shrink from feeding, it is a sign
that the body is healthy, and fit for themselves.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/336-2.jpg">
<img src="./images/336-2_th.jpg" alt="Chokden, or Tomb of a Saint" title="Chokden, or Tomb of a Saint" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Chokden, or Tomb of a Saint</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Revolting beyond words is the further fact that, when a man has died of
some pestilential disease, and, owing to the odour, the birds will not
peck at the body, nor will the famished dogs go near it, then a large
number of Lamas, having made the usual exorcisms, sit down by it, and do
not get up again until they have devoured the whole of the rotten human
flesh! The relatives and friends are wiser and less brutal. They rightly
believe that, if voracious animals will not partake of the meal proffered
them, it is because the body is that of a sinner against whom God is
angry. And who better than the Lamas could make

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_337" id="Pg_337"></a>[<a href="./images/337.png">337</a>]</span>
peace between God and him? So let the Lamas eat
it all.</p>

<p>In the case of not finding sufficient Lamas to perform
these rites, the body is either disposed of by throwing it into
the water, or else, the relations having first partaken of a
morsel of the flesh, it is bound to a rock to let animals or
time do the rest.</p>

<p>The Lamas are said to have a great craving for human
blood, which, they say, gives them strength, genius and
vigour. When sucking wounds that are not poisoned, they
drink the blood, and also on certain occasions wounds are
inflicted for the sake of sucking the blood. At other times
the cups cut from human skulls, found in all monasteries,
are filled with blood, and the Lamas in turn satisfy their
thirst out of them.</p>

<p>But enough of this. It is sickening to set it down,
though my book would be incomplete if I had made no
mention of the cannibalism of the Lamas.</p>

<p>When a saintly Lama dies, or some old man much
respected by the community, either parts of the flesh, or, if
cremation has been applied, some of his ashes, are preserved
and placed in a <i>Chokden</i> erected for the purpose; and,
judging by the number of these structures one finds all
over Tibet, one feels inclined to think that half the population
of the country must have been saints, or else that
the standard of saintliness in the sacred land of the Lamas
is not prohibitively high.</p>

<h5>Another commotion&mdash;Two hundred soldiers&mdash;A stampede&mdash;Easy
travelling&mdash;A long <i>Mani</i> wall&mdash;Mosquitoes.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Coming</span> out of our tent in the morning, we noticed an unusual commotion
among the Tibetans. A number of mounted men with matchlocks had arrived,
and others similarly armed immediately went to join them from the tents.
They seemed excited, and I kept my eye upon them while I was cooking my
food. There were some two hundred in all, picturesquely garbed. They
seemed to be good horsemen, and looked well as they rode in a line
towards us. A little way off they stopped and dismounted, and the leaders
came forward, one stalwart fellow in a fine sheepskin coat marching ahead
of the rest. His attitude was very arrogant, and, dispensing with the
usual salutations, he approached quite close, shaking his fist at me.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Kiu mahla lokhna nga rah luck tiba tangan</i>&quot; (&quot;I
will give you a goat or a sheep if you will go back&quot;), he
said.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Kiu donna nga di tangon</i>&quot; (&quot;And I give you this to
make you go back!&quot;) was my quick answer, while I unexpectedly
administered him one straight from the shoulder
that sent him flat on his back and sprawling on the ground.</p>

<p>The army, which, with its usual prudence, was watching
events from a respectful distance, beat a hasty retreat.
The officer, though unhurt, scrambled away, screaming.
The Tibetans had so far behaved with such contemptible
cowardice that we could hardly congratulate ourselves
on such easy successes. We began to feel that really we
had no enemy at all before us, and very likely we became
even careless. Anyhow, we ate our food and gave this
affair but little thought.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_340" id="Pg_340"></a>[<a href="./images/340.png">340</a>]</span>The Tibetans kept their distance, and did not trouble us
again that day. Those who had not ridden off retired
timidly inside their black tents, and not a soul was to be
seen about the encampment&mdash;which might have been
deserted, so silent and so empty did it appear. I registered
my daily observations, made a sketch of one of the black
tents, and wrote up my diary; after which we raised camp.</p>

<p class="figcenter">&quot;And I give you this to make you go back&quot;</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Our progress was now comparatively easy, along a broad
grassy plain, and we proceeded without further disturbance
in a South-easterly direction, observing a high snowy peak
at 20&deg; (b.m.), and a low pass in the mountain range to our
North-east at 55&deg; (b.m.). A very high range stood ahead
of us in the far distance, with low hills between. In going
round one of these lonely hills we found at the foot of
it another and more important <i>mani</i> wall of some length,
with numberless inscriptions of all ages and sizes on stones,
pieces of bone, skulls and horns. Farther on, to the
South, there were three smaller hillocks and two larger
ones. The soldiers we had routed at the encampment
had proceeded in the direction we were now following,
and we were, in fact, treading all along on the footprints of
their ponies.</p>

<p>We had to cross a river and a number of rivulets, and so
troublesome was it each time to take off one's shoes and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_341" id="Pg_341"></a>[<a href="./images/341.png">341</a>]</span>
clothes to wade through, that we bundled up our clothes on
the yaks, and travelled along for the rest of the afternoon
bare-footed and with nothing on but a <i>doti</i> (loin-cloth), in
the style adopted by fakirs.</p>

<p>In an arc of a circle from 120&deg; to 180&deg; (b.m.) we noticed
very low hills, and from 160&deg; to 220&deg;, some thirty or forty
miles off, could be seen much more clearly now the high
range we had observed before. The sun was extremely hot,
the ground marshy, the air being thick with huge and very
troublesome mosquitoes. We were quickly covered from
head to foot with bites, and the irritation caused by them
was intense. Halting on the right bank of a large stream
at 15,600 feet, we named this spot Mosquito Camp. At
sunset the number of mosquitoes around us was such as to
drive us nearly mad, but fortunately, the moment the sun
disappeared, the thermometer fell to 33&deg;, and we had a
peaceful night.</p>

<p>In the evening we saw a number of horsemen riding full
speed on a course about one mile south of ours, but converging
to the same direction. No doubt they were sent
to keep the authorities ahead well informed of our movements.</p>

<h5>Washing-day&mdash;A long march&mdash;<i>Kiang</i> and antelope&mdash;Benighted&mdash;The
purchase of a goat&mdash;Ramifications of the Brahmaputra&mdash;A d&eacute;tour&mdash;Through
a swamp&mdash;Mansing again lost and found.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next was for us a great washing-day. The water of
the stream was so pleasant and clear that we could not resist
the temptation of having a regular cleaning up, washing
first our clothing and spreading it to dry in the sun, and
then cleansing our faces and bodies thoroughly with soap,
a luxury unknown to us for ever so long.</p>

<p>While I was drying myself in the sun&mdash;owing to the want
of towels&mdash;I registered at 211&deg; (b.m.) a very high snowy
peak, and a lower one at 213&deg; 30&#8242; forming part of the
chain before us. There were mountains on every side
of the plain we were traversing; and another very elevated
peak, of which I had taken bearings on a previous occasion,
was at 20&deg; (b.m.). A break occurred in the hill range to
our North-east, showing a narrow valley, beyond which
were high snowy mountains. We made a very long march
along the grassy plain, going to 147&deg; (b.m.), and encamped
on the bank of the Brahmaputra, here already a wide, deep
and very rapid stream. We had passed hundreds of <i>kiang</i>
and antelopes, and shortly before sunset I took a walk to
the hills to try and bring some fresh meat to camp. I stalked
a herd of antelopes, and having gone some five miles from
camp, I was benighted, and on my return had the greatest
difficulty in finding my men in the darkness. They had
been unable to light a fire, and as they had both gone fast
asleep, I received no answer to my calls. We had selected
a sheltered depression in the ground for our camp, and
there being hundreds of similar spots everywhere round it,
and no landmarks to go by, it was by no means easy to
identify the exact place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_343" id="Pg_343"></a>[<a href="./images/343.png">343</a>]</span>Fortunately, at last, after I had shouted for some considerable
time, Chanden Sing heard me, and, by the sound
of his voice, I found my way back. In the morning we
noticed a large encampment about a mile off on the
opposite bank of the Brahmaputra, where we might have
obtained provisions, but the stream was too rapid for us to
cross; moreover, we saw black tents in every direction on
our side of the water, and therefore there was no reason to
go to the extra trouble and danger of crossing the stream.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">Kiang</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Much to our delight, we succeeded in purchasing a goat
from some passing Tibetans, who drove before them a flock
of several thousand heads, and, as we could not find sufficient
dry fuel to make a fire, we entrusted Mansing with the safe-conduct
of the animal to our next camp, where we proposed
to feast on it.</p>

<p>The Brahmaputra had here several ramifications mostly
ending in lakelets, and rendering the plain a regular swamp.
The larger branch was very wide and deep, and we preferred
following it to crossing it, notwithstanding that we had to
deviate somewhat from the course which I would have
otherwise followed. We thus made a considerable <i>d&eacute;tour</i>, but
even as it was, for several miles we sank in mud up to our
knees, or waded through water, for although there were small
patches of earth with tufts of grass which rose above the
water, they collapsed on our attempting to stand upon them.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_344" id="Pg_344"></a>[<a href="./images/344.png">344</a>]</span>The whole of the Northern part of the plain was extremely
marshy. Our yaks gave us no end of trouble, for when they
sank unexpectedly in soft mud-holes, they became restless
and alarmed, and in their struggles to save themselves, once
or twice shook off their pack-saddles and loads, which we
had not been able to fasten properly for want of ropes.
Chanden Sing and I, however, managed to keep up with
them, and at last, on nearing the hills, the ground showed
greater undulations and was rather drier. We saw columns
of smoke rising from near the foot of the range to the North
of us. We went on another couple of miles, exhausted and
dirty, our clothes, which we had spent so much soap and
time in washing, filthy with splashes of mud.</p>

bearer.</p>

<p>&quot;He remained behind at the beginning of the swamp. He
was too exhausted to drag along the goat you purchased.&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_345" id="Pg_345"></a>[<a href="./images/345.png">345</a>]</span>I was much concerned, on scouting the country all round
from a hillock with my telescope, to see no signs of the poor
fellow, and I was angry with myself for not noticing his
disappearance before. As there were many Tibetans about
the spot where he had remained, I feared foul play on their
part, and that he might have been overpowered. Again I
imagined that, weak as he was, he might have been sucked
down in one of the deeper mud-holes, without a chance of
saving himself. I left Chanden Sing to look after the yaks
and turned back in search of him. As I hurried back mile
after mile, struggling again half across the mud swamp, and
yet saw no signs of the poor coolie, I was almost giving up
my quest in despair, when my eye caught something moving
about half a mile farther on. It was the goat all by itself.
I made for it with a sinking heart.</p>

<p>It was only on getting quite close to it that I perceived
the poor coolie, lying flat and half sunk in the mud. He
had fallen in a faint, and though he was still breathing, he
was quite insensible. Fortunately he had taken the precaution
of tying the rope of the <i>rabbu</i> tight round his arm, and
thus not only was it owing to the animal that I had found
his whereabouts, but I had also saved our precious acquisition.
With some rubbing and shaking I brought the poor
fellow back to life, and supported him by the arm until we
rejoined Chanden Sing. Not till the middle of the night
did we reach Tarbar, a large Tibetan encampment at the
foot of the hill range.</p>

<h5>The alarm given&mdash;Our bad manners&mdash;A peaceful settlement&mdash;A large
river&mdash;Gigantic peak&mdash;Again on marshy soil.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> alarm of our arrival, given first by scores of dogs
barking at us, then by one of the natives who had ventured
to leave his tent to find out the cause of the disturbance,
created the usual panic in the place.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Gigri duk! gigri duk! Jogpa, Jogpa!</i>&quot; (&quot;Danger, danger;
help, brigands!&quot;) cried the Tibetan, running frantically out
of his tent; and a few seconds later, black figures could be
seen everywhere, rushing in and out of their tents in a state
of confusion. It must be remembered that, according to
the manners of Tibet, one should time one's arrival at an
encampment so as to reach it before sundown, unless notice
of one's approach is sent ahead. People who arrive unexpectedly
in the middle of the night are never credited
with good motives, and their appearance is associated
with all sorts of evil intentions, murder, robbery or extortion.
I tried to set the minds of the good folk at ease,
by stating that I meant no harm; but such was their
excitement and confusion that I could get no one to listen
to me.</p>

<p>Two old women came to us with a bucket of milk and
laid it at my feet, entreating me to spare their lives; and
great was their astonishment when, instead of finding themselves
murdered, they received a silver rupee in payment.
This was the first step towards a peaceful settlement of the
disturbance. After some time, calm was restored and,
though still regarded with considerable suspicion, we were
politely treated by the natives.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, here too we were unable to purchase
provisions, the natives declaring that they had not sufficient
for themselves. So, having feasted on the <i>rabbu</i> which we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_347" id="Pg_347"></a>[<a href="./images/347.png">347</a>]</span>
killed, and on yak's milk, we made preparations to strike
camp early next morning.</p>

<p>At night the thermometer fell to 26&deg;, and the cold was very great;
but we purchased a quantity of dung from the natives and made a fine fire
in the morning; and, having had a good meal after several days'
privations, we felt happier than usual. The natives begged as ever,
showing their unrestrained craving for money, to get which they would
lower themselves to anything.</p>

<p>North-west of the encampment, through a gorge, flowed a wide river which
skirted the foot of the mountains. It was snow-fed, for in the evening
the current was strong and deep, whereas early in the morning the level
of the water was several feet lower, being, however, even then hardly
fordable. On leaving Tarbar, we followed for a while the course of the
river, and, the day being glorious, we were able to admire
fully the magnificent panorama of the great rugged mountain-range
to our South-west. The higher peaks were nearly
all of a pyramidical shape, and at 226&deg; 30&#8242; (b.m.) I observed
a gigantic quadrangular peak which I took to be Mount
Everest. Next to it, at 225&deg; 30&#8242; (b.m.), is a pyramidical peak,
very lofty, but not to be compared in height or beauty to its
neighbour. I followed a general course towards 120&deg; (b.m.),
and as the river, which we had more or less followed, now
described a big bend towards the S.S.E., I decided to cross
it. We waded through it successfully with water up to our
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_348" id="Pg_348"></a>[<a href="./images/348.png">348</a>]</span>
necks, and again we found ourselves upon marshy land,
with a repetition of the previous day's experience.</p>

<p>Farther on, we crossed three more tributaries of the larger stream, all
fairly wide and deep; and then we had once more to get across the main
river, now of such depth and rapidity as to cause us much trouble and no
small danger. The river traverses the plain in zigzag fashion, and,
unless we wanted to follow its banks, and so lengthen the journey by
double or treble the distance, this was the only course open to us. Thus,
while trying to travel in a straight line, we found ourselves for the
third time confronted by this great river, now swollen by other snow-fed
streams, and carrying an immense body of water. It was in the afternoon,
too, when the water was at its highest. We attempted a crossing at
several points, but found it impossible; so I made up my mind to wait for
low water early next morning.</p>

Contrivance for Carrying Loads</div>
<p><span class="smcap">Apparently</span> my yaks knew this part of the country well; and I noticed
that, whenever I lost the track, all I had to do was to follow them, and
they would bring me back to it again. Even when I drove them away from
the track, they showed a great disinclination to move, whereas they
proceeded willingly enough while we were on the high road, which, mark
you, is no road at all, for no track is visible except here and there,
where the footprints of the last nomads with their sheep, ponies and yaks
have destroyed the grass.</p>

<p>Half a mile on the other side of the river
was an encampment of some fifty or sixty
tents, with hundreds of yaks and sheep grazing near it.</p>

<p>At this point my two yaks, which I noticed had been
marching with more than usual smartness, bolted while I
was ordering Chanden Sing and Mansing to take down the
loads, and went straight into the water.</p></div>

<p>In attempting to make them turn back, Mansing threw a
stone at them, which, however, only sent them on all the
faster. The current was so strong, and the bottom of the
river so soft, that they both sank, and when they reappeared
on the surface it was only to float rapidly away down
stream. We watched them with ever-increasing anxiety, for
they seemed quite helpless. We ran panting along the river
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_350" id="Pg_350"></a>[<a href="./images/350.png">350</a>]</span>
bank, urging them on with shouts to drive them to the other
side. Alas, in their desperate struggle to keep afloat, and
powerless against the current, the two yaks collided violently
in mid-stream, and the bump caused the pack-saddle and
loads of the smaller yak to turn over. The animal, thus
overbalanced and hampered, sank and reappeared two or
three times, struggling for air and life. It was, indeed, a
terrible moment. I threw off my clothes and jumped into
the water. I swam fast to the animal, and, with no small
exertion, pulled him on shore, some two hundred yards
farther down the stream. We were both safe, though
breathless, but, alas! the ropes that held the baggage had
given way, and saddle and loads had disappeared. This
loss was a dreadful blow to us. I tried hard, by repeatedly
diving into the river, until I was almost frozen, to recover
my goods, but failed to find them or even to locate them.
Where I suspected them to be the water was over twenty
feet deep, and the bottom of the river was of soft mud;
so that the weight of the loads would have caused them to
sink and be covered over with it.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Rescuing a Yak</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Diving at such very great elevations gave one a peculiar
and unpleasant sensation. The moment I was entirely
under water, I felt as if I were compressed under an appalling
weight which seemed to crush me. Had the liquid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_351" id="Pg_351"></a>[<a href="./images/351.png">351</a>]</span>
above and around me been a mass of lead instead of water,
it could not have felt heavier. The sensation was especially
noticeable in my head, which felt as if my skull were being
screwed into a vice. The beating at my temples was so
strong that, though in ordinary circumstances I can remain
under water for over a minute, I could there never bold
out for longer than fifteen or twenty seconds. Each
time that I emerged from below, gasping for air, my heart
beat alarmingly hard, and my lungs seemed as if about to
burst.</p>

<p>I was so exhausted that I did not feel equal to conveying
across my two men, so I unloaded the stronger yak, and
then, with endless fatigue, I drove him and his mate again
into the water. Unhampered, and good swimmers as they
are, they floated away with the current and reached the
other side. Chanden Sing and Mansing, with their clothes
and mine tied into a bundle over their shoulders, got on the
animals and, after a somewhat anxious passage, they arrived
safely on my side, where we camped, my men mourning
all night over the lost property. The next morning
I made fresh attempts to recover the loads, but in vain!
Unhappily they contained all my tinned provisions, and
what little other food I had, and they had in them besides
eight hundred rupees in silver, the greater part of my
ammunition, changes of clothing and three pairs of shoes,
my copper hurricane lantern, and sundry knives and razors.</p>

<p>The only thing we recovered was the pack-saddle, which
was washed ashore some six hundred yards farther down.
Our situation can be summed up in a few words. We were
now in the centre of Tibet, with no food of any kind, no
clothes to speak of, and no boots or shoes, except those we
wore, which were falling to pieces. What little ammunition
I had left could not be relied upon, owing to its having
been in the water on several occasions; and round us we
had nothing but enemies&mdash;insignificant enemies if you like,
yet enemies for all that.</p>

<p>I got what comfort I could out of the knowledge that at
least the water-tight cases with my scientific instruments,
notes, sketches and maps were saved, and as far as I was
concerned, I valued them more than anything else I
possessed.</p>

<h5>Hungry and worn&mdash;A sense of humour&mdash;Two buckets of milk&mdash;No
food to be obtained&mdash;Chanden Sing and Mansing in a
wretched state&mdash;Their fidelity&mdash;Exhaustion.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> went on, hungry, worn out, with our feet lacerated,
cheering one another as best we could. We laughed
at our troubles; we laughed at the Tibetans and their
comical ways; we laughed at everything and everybody,
until eventually we even laughed at ourselves. When you
are hungry, the sun seems slow at describing its daily
semicircle from East to West; yet though involuntary
fasting gives you at first an acute pain in the stomach,
it doesn't become unbearable until after several days'
absolute want of food; that is to say, if you are in a way
accustomed, as we were, to extra long intervals between
one meal and the next. When we got to our third day's
fasting we were keen enough for a meal; and, perceiving
some black tents close by the mountain side, about four
miles out of our course, we made for them with hungry
haste. We purchased two bucketsful of yaks' milk, one of
which I drank there and then myself, the second being
equally divided between my two servants. That was all we
could get. They would sell us absolutely nothing else.</p>

<p>After this we moved forward again, making steady, and, if
one allows for the great elevation we were at, comparatively
rapid progress; noting down everything, and holding our
own against all comers. We encountered pleasant people,
and some unpleasant ones, but, whether their manner was
courteous or the reverse, we could nowhere obtain food for
love or money.</p>

<p>Poor Mansing and Chanden Sing, not having the same
interest that I had in my work to keep up their spirits, were
now in a dreadful condition. Cold, tired and starved, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_353" id="Pg_353"></a>[<a href="./images/353.png">353</a>]</span>
poor wretches had hardly strength left to stand on their feet,
the soles of which were badly cut and very sore. It really
made my heart bleed to see these two brave fellows
suffer as they did for my sake; and yet no word of complaint
came from them; not once did their lips utter a
reproach.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">Drinking out of a Bucket</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>&quot;Never, mind if we suffer or even die,&quot; said the poor
fellows, when I expressed my sympathy with them, &quot;we will
follow you as long as we have strength to move, and we will
stand by you, no matter what happens.&quot;</p>

<p>I had to relieve Chanden Sing of his rifle, as he was no
longer able to carry it. I myself, too, felt languid and
exhausted as the days went by, and we got scarcely any
food. I cannot say that I experienced any very severe
physical pain. This was due, I think, to the fact that my
exhaustion brought on fever. I had, nevertheless, a peculiar
feeling in my head, as if my intellect, never too bright, had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_354" id="Pg_354"></a>[<a href="./images/354.png">354</a>]</span>
now been altogether dulled. My hearing, too, became less
acute; and I felt my strength slowly dying down like the
flame of a lamp with no more oil in it. The nervous excitement
and strain alone kept me alive, and I went on walking
mechanically.</p>

<h5>Eighty black tents&mdash;Starved&mdash;Kindly natives&mdash;Presents&mdash;Ando
and his promises&mdash;A friendly Lama&mdash;A low pass&mdash;My plans.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> reached an encampment of some eighty black tents and
a mud guard-house. We were positively in a starved condition
and it was utterly impossible to proceed farther, owing
to the wretched condition of my two men. They begged
to be given ponies to ride, for their feet were so sore
that, notwithstanding their anxiety to follow me, they could
not.</p>

<p>The natives received us very kindly, and, on my applying
for them, consented to sell me ponies, clothes and provisions.
We encamped about two miles beyond the settlement,
and during the evening several persons visited my
tent, bringing gifts of flour, butter and <i>tsamba</i>, accompanied
by <i>Katas</i>, the veils of friendship. I made a point of
invariably giving the Tibetans, in return for their gifts, silver
money to an amount three or four times greater than the
value of the articles they presented us with, and they professed
to be very grateful for it. A man called Ando, who
styled himself a Gourkha, but wore the garb of the Tibetans,
came to visit us in our tent, and promised to bring for sale
several ponies the next morning. He also undertook to sell
me a sufficient quantity of food to enable us to reach Lhassa,
and, to show his good faith, brought a portion of the
supplies in the evening, and said he would let us have the
remainder the next morning.</p>

<p>We next had a visit from a Lama, who appeared both
civil and intelligent, and who presented us with some butter
and <i>chura</i> (cheese). He had travelled in India, he told us,
as far as Calcutta, and was on his way from Gartok to
Lhassa, where he expected to arrive in four or five days,
having an excellent pony. Other Lamas and men who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_356" id="Pg_356"></a>[<a href="./images/356.png">356</a>]</span>
came to see us stated that they had come from Lhassa in
that time, and I do not think that they can have been far
wrong, as the whole distance from the Lippu Pass on the
frontier (near Garbyang) to Lhassa can on horseback be
covered in sixteen days.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Mud Guard-house</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The natives, as usual, showed great reticence in letting out
the name of the encampment, some calling it Toxem, others
Taddju. North of us was a low pass in the hill range, and
having already seen as much as I wanted of the Tibetans,
it was my intention, if I succeeded in purchasing provisions
and ponies, to cross over this pass and proceed towards the
Sacred City, following a course on the northern side of the
mountain range. Besides, the highway to Lhassa was getting
so thickly populated that I thought it advisable to travel
through less inhabited regions. I intended proceeding,
dressed as a European, until within a few miles of Lhassa.
Then I would leave my two men concealed in some secluded
spot, and assuming a disguise, I would penetrate alone
during the night into the city. This would have been easy
enough, as Lhassa has no gates, and only a ruined wall
round it.</p>

<p>I succeeded in purchasing some clothing and boots from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_357" id="Pg_357"></a>[<a href="./images/357.png">357</a>]</span>
the Tibetans, and the pigtail that I needed to make me pass
for a Tibetan I intended to make myself, out of the silky
hair of my yaks. To avoid betraying myself by my inability
to speak Tibetan fluently, I thought of pretending to be
deaf and dumb.</p>

<p>A good meal brought hope and high spirits, and when I
retired to sleep I saw myself already inside the sacred
walls.</p>

A Distaff</div>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the night I was aroused several times by noises,
and I went out of my tent to look for the disturbers, but
failed to discover any one. This had become
my nightly experience, and I attached very
little importance to these sounds.</p>

<p>In the morning, Ando and two or three Tibetans came to sell us provisions
and ponies, and, while my two servants and I were engaged in purchasing
what we required, I saw a number of villagers coming up in groups. Some
spun their wool, others carried bags of <i>tsamba</i> and flour, while others
still arrived leading a number of fine ponies. Having purchased
provisions to last us a couple of months, we now began the selection of
mounts, and naturally my servants and myself were overjoyed at our
unexpected piece of luck in finding ourselves, after untold sufferings
and privations of all kinds, confronted with abundance of everything we
could possibly desire. The demeanour of the Tibetans was so friendly, and
they seemed so guileless, that I never thought of suspecting them.
Chanden Sing and Mansing, who at bottom were sportsmen of the very first
order, delighted at the prospect of getting animals, rode first one pony
and then another to suit themselves; and Chanden Sing, having selected a
handsome beast for his own use, called me to try it and examine it before
paying over the purchase-money.</p></div>

<p>Unsuspecting of foul play, and also because it would not</p>

be convenient to try the various lively ponies with my rifle slung over
my shoulder, I walked unarmed to the spot, about a hundred yards away
from my tent, where the restless animal was being held for my inspection.
The natives followed behind me, but such a thing being common in any
country when one buys a horse in public, I thought nothing of it. As I
stood with my hands behind my back, I well recollect the expression of
delight on Chanden Sing's face when I approved of his choice, and, as is
generally the case on such occasions, the crowd behind in a chorus
expressed their gratuitous opinion on the superiority of the steed
selected.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>I had just stooped to look at the pony's fore-legs, when I was suddenly
seized from behind by several persons, who grabbed me by the neck,
wrists, and legs, and threw me down on my face. I struggled and fought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_361" id="Pg_361"></a>[<a href="./images/361.png">361</a>]</span>
until I shook off some of my assailants and regained my feet;
but others rushed up, and I was surrounded by some thirty
men, who attacked me from every side, and clinging to me with
all their might succeeded in grabbing my arms, legs and head.
Weak as I was, they knocked me down three more times,
and three more times I regained my feet. I fought to the
bitter end with my fists, feet, head and teeth each time that I
got one hand or leg free from their clutches, hitting right
and left at any part where I could disable my opponents.
Their timidity, even when in such overwhelming numbers,
was indeed beyond description; and it was entirely due to it,
and not to my strength (for I had hardly any), that I was able
to hold my own against them for some twenty minutes. My
clothes were torn in the fight. Long ropes were thrown at
me from every side, and I became so entangled in them
that my movements were impeded. One rope which they
flung and successfully twisted round my neck completed
their victory. They pulled hard at it from the two ends, and
while I panted and gasped with the exertion of fighting, they
tugged and tugged to strangle me, till I felt as if my eyes
would shoot out of their sockets. I was suffocating. My
sight became dim, and I was in their power. Dragged
down to the ground, they stamped, and kicked, and trampled
upon me with their heavy nailed boots, until I was stunned.
Then they tied my wrists tightly behind my back; they bound
my elbows, my chest, my neck and my ankles. I was a
prisoner!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> lifted me and made me stand up. The brave Chanden
Sing had been struggling with all his might against fifteen or twenty
foes, and had disabled several of them. He had been pounced upon at the
same moment as I was, and had fought gallantly until, like myself, he had
been entangled, thrown down and secured by ropes. During my struggle, I
heard him call out repeatedly: &quot;<i>Banduk, banduk, Mansing; jaldi,
banduk!</i>&quot; (&quot;Rifle, rifle, Mansing; quick, my rifle!&quot;) but,
alas, poor Mansing the leper, the weak and jaded coolie, had been sprung
upon by four powerful Tibetans, who held him pinned to the ground as if
he had been the fiercest of bandits. Mansing was a philosopher. He had
saved himself the trouble of even offering any resistance; but he too,
was ill-treated, beaten and tightly bound. At the beginning of the fight
a shrill whistle had brought up four hundred<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> armed
soldiers who had lain in ambush round us, concealed behind the

counted to arrest a starved Englishman and his two half-dying servants,
and that, even then, they dared not do it openly, but had to resort to
abject treachery; when I found that these soldiers were picked troops
from Lhassa and Sigatz (Shigatze), despatched on purpose to arrest our
progress and capture us, I could not restrain a smile of contempt for
those into whose hands we had at last fallen.</p>

A Spear</div>
<p>My blood boiled when, upon the order of the Lama, who the previous night
had professed to be our friend, several men advanced and searched our
pockets. They rifled us of everything we possessed, and began overhauling
our baggage. The watches and chronometer were looked upon with suspicion,
their ticking causing anxiety and curiosity. They were passed round and
round and mercilessly thrown about from one person to the other, until
they stopped. They were then pronounced &quot;dead.&quot; The compasses
and aneroids, which they could not distinguish from watches, were soon
thrown aside, as &quot;they had no life in them,&quot; but great caution
was displayed in touching our rifles, which were lying on our bedding
when the tent had been torn down.</p>

<p>Great fears were entertained lest they should go off by themselves; and
it was only on my assurance (which made our captors ten times more
cautious) that they were not loaded, that at last they took them and
registered them in the catalogue of our confiscated property. I had upon
me a gold ring that my mother had given me when I was a child. I asked
permission to retain it, and with their superstitious nature they
immediately thought that it had occult powers, like the wands one reads
of in fairy tales.</p>

<p>A man called Nerba, who later on played an important
part in our sufferings, was entrusted with it, and warned
never to let me see it again. As we three prisoners sat bound
and held down by guards it was heartbreaking to see the
Lamas and officers handle all our things so roughly as to
spoil nearly all they touched; but particularly disgusting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_365" id="Pg_365"></a>[<a href="./images/365.png">365</a>]</span>
was their avidity when, in searching the pockets of the coat
I wore daily, and which I had not put on that morning,
they found a quantity of silver coins, some eight hundred
rupees in all. Officers, Lamas and soldiers made a grab for
the money, and when order was re-established, only a few
coins remained where the sum had been laid down. Other
moneys which they found in one of our loads met with a
similar fate. Among the things arousing greatest curiosity
was an india-rubber pillow fully blown out. The soft, smooth
texture of the india-rubber seemed to catch their fancy, and
one after the other they rubbed their cheeks on the cushion,
exclaiming at the pleasant sensation it gave them. However,
in playing with the brass screw by which the cushion was inflated,
they gave it a turn, and the imprisoned air found its way
out with a hissing noise. This created quite a panic among
the Tibetans, and many were the conjectures of their superstitious
minds as to the meaning of the strange contrivance.
They regarded it as an evil omen, and naturally I took
advantage of any small incident of this kind to work judiciously
on their superstitions and frighten them as much as
I could.</p></div>

placed on yaks and brought into the guard-house of the
settlement. This done, they tied the end of the ropes that
bound our necks to the pommels of their saddles, and,
having loosed our feet, they sprang on their ponies and
rode off, with shouts, hisses and cries of victory, firing their
matchlocks in the air, and dragging us prisoners into the
settlement.</p>

<h5>A warning to my men&mdash;Calm and coolness&mdash;The Pombo's
tent&mdash;Chanden Sing cross-examined and flogged.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> reaching the settlement, my last words to my men
before we were separated were, &quot;No matter what they do
to you, do not let them see that you suffer,&quot; and they
promised to obey me. We were then conveyed to different
tents. I was dragged to one of the larger tents, inside and
outside of which soldiers were placed on guard. Those near
me were at first sulky, and rough in their manner and
speech, but I always made a point of answering them in
as collected and polite a fashion as I could. I had on many
previous occasions found that nothing carries one further in
dealings with Asiatics than to keep calm and cool, and I
saw in a moment that, if we were ever to get out of our
present scrape, it would be by maintaining a perfectly
impassive demeanour in face of anything that might take
place. Whether I acted my part well it is not for me to
say, but the reader can satisfy himself on that point by
perusing the Government inquiry and report made by
Mr. J. Larkin, and given in the Appendix to this book.</p>

<p>The tent being kept closed, I was unable to discover what
happened outside, but from the noises I heard of people
rushing hither and thither, and of shouted orders, besides
the continuous tinkling of the soldiers' horse-bells as they
galloped past the tent, I concluded that the place must be
in a state of turmoil. I had been some three hours in the
tent, when a soldier entered and ordered me out.</p>

<p>&quot;They are going to cut off his head,&quot; said he to his
comrades; and, turning round to me, he made a significant
gesture with his hand across his neck.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Nikutza</i>&quot; (&quot;All right&quot;), said I drily.</p>

<p>It must not be forgotten that, when a Tibetan himself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_368" id="Pg_368"></a>[<a href="./images/368.png">368</a>]</span>
hears words of this import, he usually goes down on his
knees and implores to be spared, with tears, and sobs,
and prayers in profusion. So it is not surprising that
the Tibetans were somewhat astonished at my answer,
and seemed puzzled as to what to make of it. Anyhow,
the first ardour of the messenger was sensibly cooled
down, and I was led out with more reluctance than
firmness.</p>

<p class="figcenter">The Pombo's Tent</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>During the time I had been shut up, a huge white tent
with blue ornaments had been pitched in front of the mud-house,
and round it were hundreds of soldiers and villagers&mdash;a
most picturesque sight.</p>

<p>As I was led nearer, I perceived that the front of the
tent was wide open, and inside stood a great number of red
Lamas, with shaven heads, in their long woollen tunics.
The soldiers stopped me when I was about twenty yards from
the tent. Additional ropes were added to those already
cutting into my wrists, elbows and chest, and the others made
tighter. I perceived Chanden Sing led forward, and then,
instead of taking me before the Lamas, they pushed me to
the rear of the solitary mud-house to preclude my witnessing
the scene that followed. I heard Chanden Sing being
interrogated in a loud angry tone of voice, and accused of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_369" id="Pg_369"></a>[<a href="./images/369.png">369</a>]</span>
having been my guide. Next I heard wild shouts from the
crowd, then a dead silence. A few instants later I distinguished
the snapping noise of a lash, followed by hoarse
moans from my poor bearer, to whom they were evidently
applying it.</p>

<p>I counted the strokes, the sickening noise of which is
still well impressed on my memory, as they regularly and
steadily fell one after the other to twenty, to thirty, forty,
and fifty. Then there was a pause.</p>

<h5>Led before the tribunal&mdash;The Pombo&mdash;Classical Tibetan
beyond me&mdash;Chanden Sing lashed&mdash;The Lamas puzzled&mdash;A sudden
change in the Pombo's attitude.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">A number</span> of soldiers now came for me, and I was first led,
then pushed violently before the tribunal.</p>

<p>On a high seat in the centre of the tent sat a man wearing
ample trousers of gaudy yellow and a short yellow coat
with flowing sleeves. On his head he had a huge four-pointed
hat gilt all over, and with three great eyes painted
on it. He was young-looking, and his head was clean
shaven, as he was a Lama of the highest order, a Grand
Lama and a <i>Pombo</i>, or Governor of the province, with powers
equivalent to those of a feudal king. On his right stood a
stout and powerful red Lama who held a huge double-handed
sword, and behind, and at the sides, were a number
of other Lamas, officers and soldiers. As I stood silent,
and with my head held high before him, two or three Lamas
rushed at me and ordered me to kneel. They tried to
compel me to do so, by forcing me on my knees, but I
succeeded in maintaining an upright posture.</p>

<p>The Pombo, who was furious at my declining to kneel
before him, addressed me in words that sounded violent;
but, as he spoke classical Tibetan, and I only the colloquial
language, I could not understand a word of what he said,
and I meekly asked him not to use such fine words, as they
were unintelligible to me.</p>

<p>The great man was taken aback at this unheard-of request;
and, with a frown on his face, he pointed to me to look to my
left. The soldiers and Lamas drew aside, and I beheld
Chanden Sing lying flat on his face, stripped from the waist
downwards, in front of a row of Lamas and military men.
Two powerful Lamas, one on each side of him, began again</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_372" id="Pg_372"></a>[<a href="./images/372.png">372</a>]</span>
to castigate him with knotted leather thongs weighted with lead, laying
on their strokes with vigorous arms from his waist to his feet. He was
bleeding all over. Each time that a lash fell on his wounded skin it felt
as if a dagger had been stuck into my chest; but I knew Orientals too
well to show any pity for the man, as this would have only involved a
more severe punishment for him. So I looked on at his torture as one
would upon a thing of everyday occurrence. The Lamas nearer to me shook
their fists under my nose, and explained that my turn would come next,
whereupon I smiled and repeated the usual &quot;<i>Nikutza, nikutza</i>&quot;
(&quot;Very good, very good&quot;).</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<img src="./images/372_th.jpg" alt="The Pombo" title="The Pombo" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">The Pombo</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The Pombo and his officers were at a loss what to make of me, as I could
plainly see by their faces; so that the more I perceived how well my plan
was answering, the more courage I screwed up to play my part to the best
of my ability.</p>

<p>The Pombo, an effeminate, juvenile, handsome person, almost hysterical in
manner, and likely to make a splendid subject for hypnotic experiments (I
had reason to think, indeed, that he had already often been under
mesmeric influence), remained with his eyes fixed upon mine as if in a
trance for certainly over two minutes.</p>

<p>There was a wonderful and sudden change in the man,
and his voice, arrogant and angry a few moments before,
was now soft and apparently kindly. The Lamas around
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_373" id="Pg_373"></a>[<a href="./images/373.png">373</a>]</span>
him were evidently concerned at seeing their lord and
master transformed from a foaming fury to the quietest of
lambs. They seized me and brought me out of his sight
to the spot where Chanden Sing was being chastised.
Here again I could not be compelled to kneel, so at last I
was allowed to squat down before the Pombo's officers.</p>

<h5>My note-books and maps&mdash;What the Lamas wanted me to say&mdash;My
refusal&mdash;Anger and threats&mdash;Ando, the traitor&mdash;Chanden
Sing's heroism&mdash;A scene of cruelty&mdash;Rain.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> two Lamas, leaving Chanden Sing, produced my note-books and maps, and
proceeded to interrogate me closely, saying that, if I spoke the truth, I
should be spared, otherwise I should be flogged and then beheaded.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/374.jpg">
<img src="./images/374_th.jpg" alt="A Soldier" title="A Soldier" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">A Soldier</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>I answered that I would speak the truth, whether they punished me or not.</p>

<p>One of the Lamas, a great big brute, who was dressed up in a gaudy red
silk coat, with gold embroidery at the collar, and who had taken part in
the flogging of Chanden Sing, told me I must say &quot;that my servant
had shown me the road across Tibet, and that he had done the maps and
sketches.&quot; If I would say this, they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_375" id="Pg_375"></a>[<a href="./images/375.png">375</a>]</span>
were willing to release me and have me conveyed back to
the frontier, promising to do me no further harm. They
would cut my servant's head off, that was all, but no personal
injury should be inflicted on me.</p>

<p>I explained clearly to the Lamas that I alone was responsible for the
maps and sketches, and for finding my way so far inland. I repeated
several times, slowly and distinctly, that my servant was innocent, and
that therefore there was no reason to punish him. He had only obeyed my
orders in following me to Tibet, and I alone, not my two servants, was to
be punished if anybody was punishable.</p>

<p>The Lamas were angry at this, and one of them struck me violently on the
head with the butt-end of his riding-crop. I pretended not to notice it,
though it made my scalp ache and smart.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">Soldier with Pigtail wound round his Head</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>&quot;Then we shall beat you and your man until you say what we
want,&quot; the Lama exclaimed angrily.</p>

<p>&quot;You can beat us if you like,&quot; I replied with assurance,
&quot;but if you punish us unjustly it will go against
yourselves. You can tear our skin off, and you can
make us bleed to death, but you cannot make us feel
pain.&quot;</p>

<p>Ando, the traitor, who spoke Hindustani fluently, acted
as interpreter whenever there was a hitch in our Tibetan
conversation, and with what I knew of the language, and
with this man's help, everything was explained to the
Tibetans as clearly as possible. Notwithstanding this, they
continued mercilessly to lash my poor servant, who, in his
agony, was biting the ground as each blow fell on him and
tore away patches of skin and flesh. Chanden Sing behaved
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_376" id="Pg_376"></a>[<a href="./images/376.png">376</a>]</span>
heroically. Not a word of complaint, nor a prayer for
mercy, came from his lips. He said that he had spoken
the truth and had nothing more to say. Watched intently
by all the Lamas and soldiers, I sat with affected stoicism
before this scene of cruelty, until, angry at my phlegm, order
was given to the soldiers that I should be dragged away.
Again they led me behind the mud-house, from where I
could distinctly hear the angry cries of the Lamas cross-examining
Chanden Sing, and those dreadful sounds of the
lash still being administered.</p>

<p>It began to rain heavily, and this was a bit of luck for us,
for in Tibet, as in China, a shower has a great effect upon
the people, and even massacres have been known to be put
a stop to until the rain should cease.</p>

<p>Such was the case that day. The moment the first drops
fell, the soldiers and Lamas rushed here, there, and everywhere
inside the tents, and I was hastily dragged to the
most distant tent of the settlement, which became packed
with the guards into whose charge I had been given.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> officer of high rank was sitting cross-legged at the farther

large pieces of coral and malachite was passed through his belt.</p></div>

<p>This man, apparently between fifty and sixty years of age, had an
intelligent, refined, honest, good-natured face; and somehow or other I
felt from the very first moment I saw him that he would be a friend. And,
indeed, whereas the soldiers and Lamas treated me with brutality and took
every mean advantage that they could, this officer was alone in showing
some deference to me and some appreciation of my behaviour. He made room
by his side and signed that I might sit there.</p></div>

<p>&quot;I am a soldier,&quot; said he in a dignified tone, &quot;not a
Lama. I have come from Lhassa with my men to arrest you, and you are now
our prisoner. But you have shown no fear, and I respect you.&quot;</p>

<p>So saying, he inclined his head and
laid his forehead touching mine, and
pulled out his tongue. Then he made a gesture signifying
that, though he wished to, he could not then say more,
owing to the presence of the soldiers.</p></div>

<p>Later on we entered into a most amicable conversation, in
the course of which he said that he was a Rupun (a grade
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_378" id="Pg_378"></a>[<a href="./images/378.png">378</a>]</span>
below that of general). I tried to explain to him all about English
soldiers and weapons, and he displayed the keenest interest in all I told
him. In return he gave me interesting information about the soldiers of
Tibet. Every man in Tibet is considered a soldier in time of war or when
required to do duty, but for the regular army all lads that are strong
and healthy can enlist from the age of seventeen, those deformed or
weakly being rejected as unfit for service. Good horsemanship is one of
the qualities most appreciated in the Tibetan soldier, and, after that,
unbounded obedience. The Rupun swore by the Tibetan matchlocks, which he
believed to be the most serviceable weapons on earth; for, according to
him, as long as you had powder enough, you could use anything as a
missile. Pebbles, earth, or nails did as good work as any lead bullet.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/378.jpg">
<img src="./images/378_th.jpg" alt="Flint-and-steel Pouch" title="Flint-and-steel Pouch" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Flint-and-steel Pouch</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>He told me that large quantities of these weapons were manufactured at
Lhassa and Sigatz (Shigatze), and he stated that the majority of Tibetan
men outside the towns possess one. Gunpowder was also made with saltpetre
and sulphur found in the country.</p>

<p>The Rupun, seeing how quick
I was at picking up words, took a special delight in teaching
me, as one would a child, the names of the several grades
in the Tibetan army. The <i>Tchu-pun</i><a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> was the lowest grade,
and only had ten men under him; then came the <i>Kiatsamba-pun</i>
or <i>Kia-pun</i>,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> or officer in command of one hundred
soldiers; and the <i>Tung-pun</i>,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> or head of one thousand.
These officers, however, are seldom allowed the full complement
of soldiers according to their grade, and very often
the &quot;commander of one thousand&quot; has only under him
three or four hundred men at the most. Above the <i>Tung-pun</i>
comes the <i>Rupun</i>, a kind of adjutant-general; then the
<i>Dah-pun</i>, or great officer; and highest of all, the <i>Mag-pun</i>
(or <i>Mag-bun</i>, as it is usually pronounced), the general in
chief.</p>

<p>The acquaintance of one of these generals we had already
made at Gyanema. Though my informant said that officers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_379" id="Pg_379"></a>[<a href="./images/379.png">379</a>]</span>
are elected for their bravery in time of war and
for their strength and aptitude in the saddle and
with their weapons, I knew well enough that such
was not the case. The posts are mainly given to
whoever can afford to pay most for them, and to
men of families under special protection of the
Lamas. In many cases they are actually sold by
auction.</p>

<p>The method described by the Rupun was nevertheless

are chosen.</p>

<h5>Sarcasm appreciated&mdash;Kindness&mdash;A change for the worse&mdash;The
place for an Englishman&mdash;Vermin&mdash;A Tibetan prayer.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Rupun possessed a good deal of dry humour, and I told him how fast
the Tibetan soldiers had run away on previous occasions when I had met
them and had my rifle by me. But he was quite equal to the situation and
exclaimed: &quot;Yes, I know that they ran, but it was not through fear.
It was because they did not wish to hurt you.&quot; Upon which I answered
that, if that were the case, they need not have run so fast.</p>

<p>The Rupun seemed amused and laughed at my sarcasm. He patted me on the
back and said I was right. He professed to be grieved to see me tied up,
and said he had received strict orders not to give me food or unloose my
bonds.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The soldiers, who had been listening open-mouthed to the affable and
friendly conversation between the Rupun and myself, a practice not common
in Tibet between captor and prisoner, followed their chief's example, and
from being harsh and rough, turned quite kindly and respectful. They
placed a cushion under me and tried to make me as comfortable as they
could in the circumstances.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_381" id="Pg_381"></a>[<a href="./images/381.png">381</a>]</span>Towards the evening, however, the Rupun was summoned
before the Pombo, and the guard was relieved by a fresh
lot of men. This was a change for the worse. Their
manner was extremely rough, and they dragged me away
from the dignified seat I had occupied in the place of
honour in the tent, and knocked me violently down on a
heap of dung which they used for fuel.</p>

<p>&quot;That is the place for <i>plenkis!</i>&quot; shouted one of the men,
&quot;not in the best part of the tent.&quot;</p>

<p>They pounced upon me roughly, and though I made no
resistance whatever, they again tied my feet together, and
another rope was fastened round my knees. The ends of
these ropes were left long, and each was given in charge of
a soldier.</p>

<p>No part of a Tibetan tent is over clean, but the spot
where I was to rest for the night was the dirtiest. Bound
so tightly that the ropes cut channels in my flesh, it was
out of the question to sleep; but tenfold worse than this was
the disgusting fact that I soon got covered with vermin,
which swarmed in the tent. From this time till the end of
my captivity, or twenty-five days later, I suffered unspeakable
tortures from this pest. The guards, with their swords
drawn, were all round me inside the tent, and others were
posted outside.</p>

<p>The night was full of strange events. Shouts could be
heard at intervals from a distance outside, and some one of
the guard in the tent answered them. They were to keep
the men awake and make sure that I was still there. One
of the soldiers in the tent revolved his prayer-wheel,
muttering the following prayer so often that I learned it by
heart:</p>

Puku, or Wooden Cup</div>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the middle of the night the Rupun returned. I noticed
he seemed very much upset. He sat by my side, and by
the light of the flickering fire and a wick
burning in a brass bowl filled with butter, I
could see in his face an expression of great
anxiety. I felt, by the compassionate way
in which he looked at me, that he had grave
news to give me. I was not mistaken. He
moved me from the pestilent place where I had been thrown
down helpless by the soldiers, and laid me in a more comfortable
and cleaner part of the tent. Then he ordered a
soldier to bring me a blanket. Next, to my astonishment,
he became very severe, and said he must examine my bonds.
He turned quite angry, scolding the soldiers for leaving me
so insecurely tied, and proceeded to make the knots firmer,
a thing which I felt was impossible. Though he pretended
to use all his strength in doing this, I found, much to my
amazement, that my bonds were really becoming
loosened. He then quickly covered
me up with the heavy blanket.</p></div>

<div class="clearfix"><div class="figright">

Puku, or Wooden Cup</div>
<p>The soldiers were at the other end of the
large tent, and seemed occupied with a loud
argument over some paltry matter. The
Rupun, stooping low, and making pretence
to tuck me in the blanket, whispered:</p>

<p>&quot;Your head is to be cut off to-morrow. Escape to-night.
There are no soldiers outside.&quot;</p>

<p>The good man was actually preparing everything for my
flight. He put out the light, and came to sleep by my side.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_384" id="Pg_384"></a>[<a href="./images/384.png">384</a>]</span>
It would have been comparatively easy, when all the men
had fallen asleep, to slip from under the tent and steal away.
I had got my hands easily out of the ropes, and should have
had no difficulty in undoing all my other bonds; but the
thought that I should be leaving my two men at the
mercy of the Tibetans prevented my carrying the escape
into effect. The Rupun, having risen to see that the
guard were asleep, lay down again close to me and
murmured:</p></div>

<p>&quot;<i>Nelon, nelon; palad&#466;</i>&quot; (&quot;They are asleep; go&quot;).</p>

<p>Well meant and tempting as the offer was, I told him I
must stay with my men.</p>

<p>Having my hands free, I managed to sleep a little during
the night; and when the morning came I slipped my hands
again inside the ropes.</p>

<p>The Rupun, who seemed much disappointed, tied the
ropes round my wrists firmly again, and, though he appeared
rather vexed at my not having availed myself of the chance
of flight he had given me, he treated me with ever-increasing
respect and deference. He even produced his
<i>puku</i> (wooden bowl), which he filled with steaming tea
from the <i>raksang</i>,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> and lifted it up to my mouth for me
to drink.</p>

<p>On perceiving how thirsty and hungry I was, not only
did this good man refill the cup time after time until my
thirst was quenched, but he mixed with it <i>tsamba</i>, and
lumps of butter, which he then stuffed into my mouth with
his fingers.</p>

<p>It was really touching to see how, moved to kindness, the
soldiers imitated his example, and, one after the other, produced
handfuls of <i>tsamba</i> and <i>chura</i>, and deposited them
in my mouth. Their hands, it is true, were not over clean,
but on such occasions it does not do to be too particular,
and I was so hungry that the food they gave me seemed
delicious. I had been for two nights and one day
without food, and, what with the exertion of the fight and
my various exciting experiences, my appetite was very
keen.</p>

<p>This great politeness, however, and the sympathy with
which not only the Rupun, but even the soldiers treated me
now, made me suspect that my end was indeed near. I was
grieved not to be able to obtain news of Chanden Sing and
Mansing; and the soldiers' reticence in answering questions
regarding them made me fear that something awful had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_385" id="Pg_385"></a>[<a href="./images/385.png">385</a>]</span>
happened. Nevertheless, though my gaolers were friendly,
I did not betray any anxiety, but pretended to take all
that came as a matter of course. I spent the first portion of
the day in a lively conversation with the soldiers, partly to
divert my thoughts and partly to improve my knowledge of
Tibetan.</p>

<h5>A bearer of bad news&mdash;Marched off to the mud-house&mdash;Mansing&mdash;Insults
and humiliations&mdash;Iron handcuffs instead
of ropes&mdash;The Rupun's sympathy&mdash;No more hope&mdash;In the
hands of the mob.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> in the afternoon a soldier entered the tent, and
striking me on the shoulder with his heavy hand, shouted:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ohe!</i>&quot; (This is a Tibetan exclamation always used by
the rougher classes when beginning a conversation. It
corresponds to &quot;Look here.&quot;)</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Ohe!</i>&quot; repeated he; &quot;before the sun goes down you will
be flogged, both your legs will be broken,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> they will burn
out your eyes, and then they will cut off your head!&quot;</p>

<p>The man, who seemed quite in earnest, accompanied each
sentence with an appropriate gesture illustrating his words.
I laughed at him and affected to treat the whole thing as
a joke, partly because I thought this was the best way
to frighten them and prevent them from using violence,
and partly because the programme thus laid before me
seemed so extensive that I thought it could only be intended
to intimidate me.</p>

<p>However, the words of the soldier cast a gloom over my
friendly guard in the tent, and when I tried to cheer them
up, they answered bluntly that I would not laugh for very
long. Something was certainly happening, for the men
rushed in and out of the tent, and whispered among themselves.
When I spoke to them they would answer no more,
and on my insisting, they made signs that their lips must
from now be closed.</p>

<p>About half an hour later, another person rushed into the
tent in a great state of excitement, and signalled to my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_387" id="Pg_387"></a>[<a href="./images/387.png">387</a>]</span>
guards to lead me out. This they did, after making my bonds tighter than
ever, and placing extra ropes round my chest and arms. In this fashion I
was marched off to the mud-house and led into one of the rooms. A large
number of soldiers and villagers assembled outside, and after we had
waited some time, Mansing, tightly bound, was brought into the same room.
My pleasure at seeing my man again was so great, that I forgot all about
what was happening, and paid no attention to the insults of the mob
peeping through the door. After a while a Lama came in with a smiling
face and said he had good news to give me.</p>

<p>&quot;We have ponies here,&quot; he said, &quot;and we are going to take
you back to the frontier, but the Pombo wishes to see you first to-day.
Do not make any resistance. Let us exchange the ropes round your wrists
for these iron handcuffs.&quot;</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">Soldier laying before me the Programme of Tortures</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Here he produced a heavy pair of them, which he had kept concealed under
his coat.</p>

<p>&quot;You will not wear them for more than a few moments
while we are leading you to his presence. Then you will be
free. We swear to you by the Sun and Kunjuk-Sum that
we will treat you kindly.&quot;</p>

<p>I promised not to resist, chiefly because I had no chance
of doing so. For greater safety they tied my legs and placed
a sliding knot round my neck; then I was carried out into
the open, where a ring of soldiers with drawn swords stood
round me. While I lay flat on my face on the ground, held
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_388" id="Pg_388"></a>[<a href="./images/388.png">388</a>]</span>
down firmly, they unwound the ropes from around my
wrists, and the iron fetters, joined by a heavy chain, were
substituted for them. They took some time in fastening
the clumsy padlock, after which, all being ready, they
unbound my legs.</p>

<p>They made me stand up again, and knowing that I could
not possibly get my hands free, they began to load me with
insults and offensive terms, not directed to me as an individual,
but as a <i>Plenki</i>, an Englishman. They spat upon
me and threw mud at me. The Lamas behaved worse than
any of the others, and the one who had sworn that I should
be in no way ill-used if I would submit quietly to be handcuffed
was the most prominent among my tormentors and
the keenest in urging the crowd on to further brutality.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<img src="./images/388_th.jpg" alt="My Handcuffs" title="My Handcuffs" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">My Handcuffs</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Suddenly the attention of the crowd was drawn to the
approach of the Rupun with a number of soldiers and
officers. He seemed depressed, and his face was of a
ghastly yellowish tint. He kept his eyes fixed on the ground,
and, speaking very low, ordered that I should again be conveyed
inside the mud-house.</p>

<p>A few moments later he came in and closed the door
after him, having first cleared the room of all the people
who were in it. As I have mentioned before, Tibetan
structures of this kind have a square aperture in the ceiling
by which they are ventilated and lighted.</p>

<p>The Rupun laid his forehead upon mine in sign of compassion,
and then sadly shook his head.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_389" id="Pg_389"></a>[<a href="./images/389.png">389</a>]</span>
&quot;There is no more hope,&quot; he whispered; &quot;your head will
be cut off to-night. The Lamas are bad and my heart is
aching. You are like my brother, and I am grieved....&quot;</p>

<p>The good old man tried not to let me see his emotion,
and made signs that he could stay no longer, lest he should
be accused of being my friend.</p>

<p>The mob again entered the room, and I was once more
dragged out into the open by the Lamas and soldiers.
Some discussion followed as to who should keep the key
of my handcuffs, and eventually it was handed over to one
of the officers, who mounted his pony and rode away at a
great rate in the direction of Lhassa.</p>

<h5>A pitiful scene&mdash;A struggle to get to Chanden Sing&mdash;Brutally
treated&mdash;A torturing saddle&mdash;Across country at a gallop&mdash;A
spirited pony&mdash;Sand deposits and hills&mdash;Speculation&mdash;More
horsemen coming towards us.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> then I heard the voice of my servant Chanden Sing
calling to me in a weak agonised tone:</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hazur, Hazur, hum murgiaega!</i>&quot; (&quot;Sir, sir, I am dying!&quot;)
and, turning my head in the direction from which these
painful sounds came, I perceived my faithful bearer with
his hands bound behind his back, dragging himself on his
stomach towards the door of one of the other rooms of the
mud-house. His poor face was hardly recognisable, it bore
the traces of such awful suffering.</p>

<p>I could stand no more. Pushing my guards aside with
my shoulders, I endeavoured to get to the poor wretch, and
had nearly reached him when the soldiers who stood by
sprang upon me, grappling me, and lifting me bodily off
my feet. They threw me on the back of a pony.</p>

<p>Though I now feared the worst, I tried to encourage my
brave servant by shouting to him that I was being taken to
Taklakot, and that he would be brought after me the following
day. He had exhausted his last atom of strength in
creeping to the door. He was roughly seized, and brutally
hurled back into the room of the mud-house, so that we
could not exchange a word more. Mansing, the coolie,
was placed, with his arms pinioned, on a bare-backed pony.
The saddle of the pony I had been thrown upon is worthy
of description. It was in reality the wooden frame of a
very high-backed saddle, from the back of which some five
or six sharp iron spikes stuck out horizontally. As I sat
on this implement of torture, the spikes caught me in the
small of my back.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_391" id="Pg_391"></a>[<a href="./images/391.png">391</a>]</span>My guard having been augmented by twenty or thirty
mounted men with muskets and swords, we set off at a
furious pace. A horseman riding in front of me led my
pony by means of a cord, as my hands were manacled
behind my back; and thus we travelled across country for
miles.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/391.jpg">

<p class="figcenter">&quot;Sir, sir, I am Dying&quot;</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>But for those awful spikes in the saddle, the ride would
not have been so very bad, for the pony I rode was a
fine spirited animal, and the country around was curious
and interesting. We proceeded along an apparently endless
succession of yellow sandhills, some of them as high as two
or three hundred feet, others not more than twenty or
thirty. The sand seemed to have been deposited more by
wind than by water, though it is also possible that the whole
basin, not very high above the level of the huge stream, may
at some time have been altogether under water. The whole
space between the mountain-range to the North of the
Brahmaputra and the river itself was covered with these
sand mounds, except in certain places where the soil was
extremely marshy, and where our ponies sank in deep soft
mud. We splashed across several rivulets and skirted a
number of ponds. From the summit of a hill to which they
led me, I could see that the hills were of much greater
circumference and height near the river edge, becoming
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_392" id="Pg_392"></a>[<a href="./images/392.png">392</a>]</span>
smaller and smaller as they approached the mountain-range
to the North. Moreover, they increased in number and size
the farther we went in an easterly direction.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<img src="./images/392_th.jpg" alt="Spiked Saddle" title="Spiked Saddle" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">Spiked Saddle</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The circumstances under which I was now travelling did
not permit me to ascertain the quality of the sand, or
make any accurate investigations as to where the sand
came from, but a glance at the country all round made
me feel sure that the sand had been conveyed there from
the South. This one could plainly see from depressions
and wavelike undulations, showing that it had travelled
(roughly) in a northerly direction; and although, having
been unable to ascertain this for a fact, I do not wish to
be too certain with regard to the movements and sources
of these sand deposits, I was pretty firmly convinced that
the sand had been deposited there by the wind, which had
carried it over the Himahlyan chain from the plains of
India.</p>

<p>My guard scoured the country from the high point of
vantage to which we had ascended. Away in the distance
to the East, we saw a large number of horsemen raising
clouds of dust; and, riding down the hill, the ponies sinking
in the soft sand, we set off in the direction of the new
comers, the surface at the bottom of the hill being more
compact and harder.</p>

<hr class="full" />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_393" id="Pg_393"></a>[<a href="./images/393.png">393</a>]</span></p>

<h5>At an unpleasant pace&mdash;Drawing near the cavalcade&mdash;A
picturesque sight&mdash;A shot fired at me&mdash;Terrible effects of the
spikes along my spine&mdash;The rope breaks&mdash;An ill omen&mdash;A
second shot misses me&mdash;Arrows&mdash;The end of my terrible ride.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> travelled mile after mile at an unpleasant pace, until we
arrived at a spot where, drawn up in a line, was the cavalcade
we had seen from the summit of the hill. It was a
beautiful sight as we approached it, though the pain which
I was undergoing rather detracted from the pleasure I should
otherwise have taken in the picturesque scene. There were
about a hundred red Lamas in the centre, with banner-men
whose heads were covered by peculiar flat fluffy hats, and
the same number of soldiers and officers in their grey, red
and black tunics; some two hundred horsemen in all.</p>

<p>The Pombo, in his yellow coat and trousers and his queer
pointed hat, sat on a magnificent pony a little in front of the
crowd of Lamas and soldiers.</p>

<p>Curiously enough, when close to this new crowd, the
horseman who led my pony let go the rope, and the pony
was lashed cruelly and left to its own devices. The soldiers
of my guard reined up and drew aside. The pony dashed
off in the direction of the Pombo and, as I passed close to
him, a man named Nerba (private secretary of the Tokchim
Tarjum), knelt down, and, taking aim with his matchlock
resting on its prop, deliberately fired a shot at me.</p>

<p>Although (I learned afterwards) this Nerba was one of the
champion shots in the country, and the distance from the
muzzle of his matchlock to me not more than four yards,
the bullet missed me, whizzing past my left ear. Probably
the speed at which my animal was proceeding saved me, as
the marksman could not take a very steady aim; but my
pony, startled at the sudden report of the matchlock at such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_394" id="Pg_394"></a>[<a href="./images/394.png">394</a>]</span>
close quarters, took fright, and began rearing and plunging.
I managed to maintain my seat, though the spikes in the
saddle were lacerating the lower part of my spine terribly.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">Nerba Firing at Me</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Several horsemen now rode up and captured my pony,
and preparations were made for another exciting number in
the programme of my tortures. In their way these noble
Lamas were of a sporting nature, but I swore to myself that,
no matter what they did to me, I would not give them the
satisfaction of seeing that they were hurting me. Acting on
this principle, I pretended not to feel the effect of the spikes
tearing the flesh off my backbone; and when they led me
before the Pombo to show him how covered with blood I
was, I expressed satisfaction at riding such an excellent pony.
This seemed to puzzle them.</p>

<p>A cord of yak's hair, about forty or fifty yards long, was
now produced, the swivel attached to one end of it fastened
to my handcuffs, and the other end held by a horseman.
We set off again on our wild career, this time followed
not only by the guard, but by the Pombo and all his men.
Once or twice I could not help turning round to see
what they were about. The cavalcade was a weird and
picturesque sight, the riders with their many-coloured
dresses, their matchlocks with red flags, their jewelled
swords, their banners with long ribbons of all colours</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_396" id="Pg_396"></a>[<a href="./images/396.png">396</a>]</span>
flying in the wind; all galloping furiously, shouting, yelling
and hissing, amidst a deafening din of thousands of horse-bells.</p>

<p>In order to accelerate our speed, a horseman rode by my side lashing my
pony to make it go its hardest. Meanwhile the horseman who held the cord
did his utmost to pull me out of the saddle, no doubt in the hope of
seeing me trampled to death by the cohort behind me. As I leaned my body
forward so as to maintain my seat, and with my arms pulled violently
backwards by the rope, the flesh was rubbed off my hands and knuckles by
the chain of the handcuffs. In places the bone was exposed; and, of
course, every tug brought me into forcible contact with the spikes and
inflicted deeper wounds. The cord, though strong, eventually and
unexpectedly gave way. The soldier who was pulling at the other end was
clumsily unhorsed, and I myself was all but thrown by the unexpected
jerk. This ludicrous incident at first provoked mirth among my escort, a
mirth which their superstitious minds immediately turned into an ill
omen.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Coat I Wore at the Time of My Capture, and Showing Effect of Spikes</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>When my pony was stopped, as well as the runaway steed
of the dismounted cavalier, I took advantage of their fears,
and assured them once more that whatever harm they
tried to do me would go against themselves. However, the
cord was retied with sundry strong knots, and, after an
interruption of a few minutes, we resumed our breakneck
gallop, I being again sent on in front.</p>

<p>Towards the end of our journey we had to go round the
curve of a sandhill, the track between this and a large pond
at its foot being very narrow. At this point I saw in front
of me a soldier posted in ambush, with his matchlock ready
to fire. The pony sank deep in the sand, and could not
travel fast here, which I suppose was the reason why this
spot had been selected. The man fired as I passed only a
few paces from him; but, as luck would have it, this second
attempt also left me untouched.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_397" id="Pg_397"></a>[<a href="./images/397.png">397</a>]</span>
Getting clear of the soft sand, and finding harder ground,
we resumed our headlong career. Several arrows were
shot at me from behind; but, though some passed very
near, not one struck me; and thus, after an interminable
ride full of incident and excitement, we arrived, towards
sunset, at our destination.</p>

<p>On the crown of a hill stood a fortress and large lamasery,
and at its foot, in front of another large structure, the
Pombo's gaudy tent had been pitched. The name of this
place, as far as I could afterwards ascertain, was Namj
Lacc&eacute; Galshio or Gyatsho.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Two</span> or three men tore me roughly off the saddle. The
pain in my spine caused by the spikes was intense. I asked
for a moment's rest. My captors, however, refused, and,
roughly thrusting me forward, said that I would be
beheaded in an instant. All the people round jeered and
made signs to me that my head would be cut off, and
insults of all kinds were showered upon me by the crowd
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_399" id="Pg_399"></a>[<a href="./images/399.png">399</a>]</span>
of Lamas and soldiers. I was hustled to the execution-ground,
which lay to the left front of the tent. On the
ground was a long log of wood in the shape of a prism.
Upon the sharp edge of this I was made to stand, and
several men held me by the body while four or five others,
using their combined strength, stretched my legs as wide
apart as they could go. Fixed in this painful position, the
brutes securely tied me by my feet to the log of wood with
cords of yak-hair. Several men were made to pull these
cords, and they were so tight that they cut grooves into my
skin and flesh in several places round my ankles and on my
feet, many of the cuts<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> being as much as three inches long.</p>

<p>When I was thus firmly bound, one ruffian, the man
Nerba, whom I have mentioned before as having fired a
shot at me, came forward and seized me from behind by the
hair of my head. My hair was long, as it had not been cut
for over five months.</p>

<p class="figcenter">The Hot Iron Torture</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The spectacle before me was overwhelming. By the
Pombo's tent stood in a row the most villainous brutes I
have ever set eyes upon. One, a powerful repulsive individual,
held in his hand a great knobbed mallet used for
fracturing bones; another carried a bow and arrows; a third
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_400" id="Pg_400"></a>[<a href="./images/400.png">400</a>]</span>
held a big two-handed sword; while others made a display
of various ghastly instruments of torture. The crowd,
thirsting for my blood, formed up in a semicircle, leaving
room for me to see the parade of the torture implements
that awaited me; and, as my eyes roamed from one figure
to the other, the several Lamas shook their
various implements to show that they were
preparing for action.</p>

<div class="clearfix"><div class="figleft">
<a href="./images/400.jpg">
<img src="./images/400_th.jpg" alt="The Taram" title="The Taram" /></a><br />
The Taram</div>
<p>A group of three Lamas stood at the entrance of the tent. They were the
musicians. One held a gigantic horn which, when blown, emitted hoarse,
thundering sounds, and his companions had one a drum and the other
cymbals. Another fellow some distance away continually sounded a huge
gong. From the moment I was made to dismount the deafening sounds of the
diabolical trio echoed all through the valley, and added to the horror of
the scene.</p>

<p>An iron bar with a handle of wood bound in red cloth was being made red
hot in a brasier. The Pombo, who had again placed something in his mouth
to produce artificial foaming at the lips, and so to show his temper,
worked himself up into a frenzy. A Lama handed him the implement of
torture (the <i>Taram</i>), now red hot, and the Pombo seized it by the
handle.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Ngaghi kin meh taxon!</i>&quot; (&quot;We will burn out your
eyes!&quot;) cried a chorus of Lamas.</p>

<p>The Pombo strode up to me, brandishing the ghastly implement.
I stared at him, but he kept his eyes away from
me. He seemed reluctant, but the Lamas around him
urged him on, lifting the man's arm towards me!</p>

<p>&quot;You have come to this country to see&quot; (alluding to
what I had stated the previous day, viz., that I was a traveller
and pilgrim, and had only come to see the country). &quot;This,
then, is the punishment for you!&quot; and with these dreadful
words the Pombo raised his arm and placed the red-hot
iron bar parallel to, and about an inch or two from, my eyeballs,
and all but touching my nose.</p>

<p>Instinctively I kept my eyes tightly closed, but the heat
was so intense that it seemed as if my eyes, the left one
especially, were being desiccated and my nose scorched.</p></div>

<p>Though the time seemed interminable, I do not think that
the heated bar was before my eyes actually longer than thirty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_401" id="Pg_401"></a>[<a href="./images/401.png">401</a>]</span>
seconds or so. Yet it was quite long enough, for, when I
lifted my aching eyelids, I saw everything as in a red mist.
My left eye was frightfully painful, and every few seconds
it seemed as if something in front of it obscured its vision.
With the right eye I could still see fairly well, except that
everything, as I have said, looked red instead of its usual
colour. The hot iron had been thrown down and was
frizzling on the wet ground a few paces from me.</p>

<h5>Bleeding all over&mdash;Insulted and spat upon&mdash;&quot;Kill him!&quot;&mdash;Urging
on the executioner&mdash;Refusal to stoop&mdash;An unpleasant
sword exercise&mdash;The execution suspended.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> position as I stood with my legs wide apart, with my
back, hands and legs bleeding, and seeing everything of a
ghastly red tinge; amidst the deafening, maddening noise
of gong, drum, cymbals and horn; insulted, spat upon by
the crowd, and with Nerba holding me so tight by my hair
as to tear handfuls of it from my scalp, was one in which I
cannot wish even my bitterest enemies to find themselves.
All I was able to do was to remain calm and composed and
to watch with apparent unconcern the preparations for the
next sufferings to be inflicted upon me.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Miumta nani sehko!</i>&quot; (&quot;Kill him with a rifle!&quot;) shouted
a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>A matchlock was now being loaded by a soldier, and such
was the quantity of gunpowder they placed in the barrel that
I made sure whoever fired it would have his head blown off;
so it was with a certain amount of satisfaction that I saw it
handed over to the Pombo. That official placed the weapon
against my forehead, with the muzzle pointing upwards.
Then a soldier leaning down, applied fire to the fuse and
eventually there was a loud report which gave my head a
severe shock, and the overloaded matchlock flew clean out
of the Pombo's hand, much to everybody's surprise. I
forced myself to laugh; and their confusion, added to the
tantalising failure of every attempt they made to hurt me,
drove the crowd to the highest pitch of fury.</p>

<p><i>&quot;Ta kossaton, ta kossaton!</i>&quot; (&quot;Kill him, kill him!&quot;) exclaimed
fierce voices all round me. &quot;<i>Ngala mangbo shidak
majidan!</i>&quot; (&quot;We cannot frighten him!&quot;) &quot;<i>Ta kossaton,
ta kossaton!</i>&quot; (&quot;Kill him, kill him!&quot;), the whole valley
resounding with their ferocious cries.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_403" id="Pg_403"></a>[<a href="./images/403.png">403</a>]</span>A huge two-handed
sword was now handed to the Pombo, who drew it out of its sheath.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/403.jpg">
<img src="./images/403_th.jpg" alt="A Bannerman" title="A Bannerman" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">A Bannerman</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>&quot;Kill him, kill him!&quot; shouted the mob once more, urging on the
executioner, who, his superstitious nature not having overcome the
ill-omened fact that the matchlock a moment before had jumped out of his
hand (which he probably attributed to the doing of some supreme power and
not to the over-charge), seemed quite reluctant to come forward.</p>

<p>I seized this moment to say that they might kill me if they wished, but
that, if I died to-day, they would all die to-morrow&mdash;an undeniable
fact, for we are all bound to die some day. This seemed to cool them for
a moment, but the excitement in the crowd was too great, and at last they
succeeded in working the Pombo up into a passion. His face
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_404" id="Pg_404"></a>[<a href="./images/404.png">404</a>]</span>
became quite unrecognisable, such was his excitement, and
he behaved like a madman.</p>

<p>At this point a Lama approached and slipped something
into the mouth of the executioner, who again foamed at the
lips. A Lama held his sword, while he turned up one sleeve
of his coat to have his arms free, and the Lamas turned up
the other for him. Then he strode towards me with slow,
ponderous steps, swinging the shiny sharp blade from side
to side before him, with his bare arms outstretched.</p>

<p>The man Nerba, who was still holding me by the hair,
was told to make me bend my neck. I resisted with what
little strength I had left, determined to keep my head erect
and my forehead high. They might kill me, true enough, they
might hack me to pieces if they chose, but never until I had
lost my last atom of strength would these ruffians make me
stoop before them. I would perish, but it should be looking
down upon the Pombo and his countrymen.</p>

<p class="figcenter">
<a href="./images/404.jpg">
<img src="./images/404_th.jpg" alt="The Executioner Brought the Sword Down to My Neck" title="The Executioner Brought the Sword Down to My Neck" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">The Executioner Brought the Sword Down to My Neck</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>The executioner, now close to me, held the sword with
his nervous hands, lifting it high above his shoulder. He
then brought it down to my neck, which he touched
with the blade, to measure the distance, as it were, for
a clean effective stroke. Then, drawing back a step, he
quickly raised the sword again and struck a blow at me with
all his might. The sword passed disagreeably close to my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_405" id="Pg_405"></a>[<a href="./images/405.png">405</a>]</span>
neck under my chin, but did not touch me. I would not
flinch, nor speak, and my demeanour seemed to impress
him almost to the point of frightening him. He became
reluctant to continue his diabolical performance; but the
impatience and turbulence of the crowd were at their
highest, and the Lamas nearer to him gesticulated like madmen
and urged him on again.</p>

<p>As I write this, their wild shouts, their bloodthirsty
countenances, are vividly brought before me. Apparently
against his will, the executioner went through the same kind
of performance on the other side of my head. This time
the blade passed so near that the point cannot have been
more than half an inch or so from my neck.</p>

<p>It seemed as if all would soon be over; yet, strange to
say, even at this culminating moment I did not seriously
realise that I should die. Why this was so I cannot say,
because everything pointed towards my end being very
near; but I had a feeling all the time that I should live to
see the end of it all. I was very sorry, if my end were
really at hand, as it seemed likely, that I should die without
seeing my parents and friends again, and that they probably
would never know how and where I had died. One is
naturally at all times reluctant to leave a world in which
one has barely had a dull moment, but, after all my wretched
experiences, sufferings and excitement, I did not realise my
peril so much as I should have done had I, for instance,
been dragged from my comfortable London flat direct on to
the execution-ground, instead of first having lived through
the recent past.</p>

<p>Naturally the scene is one that I am not likely to forget,
and I must say for the Tibetans that the whole affair was very
picturesquely carried out. Even the ghastliest ceremonies
may have their artistic side, and this particular one, performed
with extra pomp and flourish, was really impressive.</p>

<p>It appears that the unpleasant sword exercise is sometimes
gone through in Tibet previous to actually cutting off
the head, so as to make the victim suffer more before the
final blow is given. I was not aware of this at the time, and
only learnt it some weeks after. It is usually at the third
stroke that the victim is actually beheaded.</p>

<p>The Lamas were still clamouring for my head, but the
Pombo made a firm stand this time, and declined to go on with
the execution. They collected round him and seemed very
angry; they shouted and yelled and gesticulated in the wildest
fashion; and still the Pombo kept his eyes upon me in a
half-respectful, half-frightened manner, and refused to move.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXVI" id="CHAPTER_LXXXVI"></a>CHAPTER LXXXVI</h2>

<h5>Mansing arrives&mdash;A pretence of killing him&mdash;Our execution
postponed&mdash;Fed by the Lamas.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">An</span> excited consultation followed, during which, in the
midst of this scene of barbarity, my coolie Mansing
arrived. He had fallen off his bare-back pony many times,
and had been left far behind. The man who held my hair
now relinquished his grasp, while another pushed me
violently from in front, causing me to fall heavily backward,
and putting a painful strain on all the tendons of my legs.
Mansing, bruised and aching all over, was brought forward
and tied by his legs to the same log of wood to which I was
fastened. They informed me that they would kill my coolie
first, and one brutal Lama seized him roughly by the throat.
I was pushed up in a sitting posture, and a cloth was thrown
over my head and face, so that I could not see what was
being done. I heard poor Mansing groan pitifully, then
there was a dead silence. I called him, I received no answer;
so I concluded that he had been despatched. I was left in
this terrible suspense for over a quarter of an hour, when at
last they removed the cloth from over my head, and I beheld
my coolie lying before me, bound to the log and almost
unconscious, but, thank God, still alive. He told me that,
when I had called him, a Lama had placed his hand upon
his mouth to prevent him from answering, while, with the
other hand, he had squeezed his neck so tightly as to nearly
strangle him. After a while Mansing got better, and the
coolness and bravery of the poor wretch during these terrible
trials were really marvellous.</p>

<p>We were told that our execution was only postponed till
the next day, in order that we might be tortured until the
time came for us to be brought out to death.</p>

<p>A number of Lamas and soldiers stood round jeering at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_407" id="Pg_407"></a>[<a href="./images/407.png">407</a>]</span>
us. I seized the opportunity this respite afforded to hail a
swaggering Lama and ask him for some refreshment.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Orcheh, orcheh nga dappa tugu duh, chuen deh, dang, yak,
guram, tcha, tsamba pin</i>&quot; (&quot;I am very hungry, please give
me some rice, yak meat, <i>ghur</i>, tea, and oatmeal!&quot;) I asked in
my best Tibetan.</p>

<p>&quot;<i>Hum murr, Maharaja!</i>&quot; (&quot;I want butter, your Majesty&quot;)
put in Mansing, half in Hindustani and half in the Tibetan
language.</p>

<p>This natural application for food seemed to afford intense
amusement to our torturers, who had formed a ring round
us, and laughed at our appeal, while Mansing and I, both
of us famished, were left sitting bound in a most painful
position.</p>

<p>The day had now waned, and our torturers did not fail
to remind us constantly that the following day our heads
would be severed from our bodies, which I told them would
cause us no pain, for if they gave us no food we should be
dead of starvation by then.</p>

<p>Whether they realised that this might be the case, or
whether some other reasons moved them, I cannot say; but
several of the Lamas, who had been most brutal, including
one who had the previous day taken a part in Chanden
Sing's flogging, now became quite polite and treated us
with a surprising amount of deference. Two Lamas were
despatched to the monastery, and returned after some time
with bags of <i>tsamba</i> and a large <i>raksang</i> of boiling tea. I
have hardly ever enjoyed a meal more, though the Lamas
stuffed the food down my throat with their unwashed fingers
so fast that they nearly choked me.</p>

<p>&quot;Eat, eat as much as you can,&quot; said they grimly, &quot;for it
may be your last meal.&quot;</p>

<p>And eat I did, and washed the <i>tsamba</i> down with quantities
of buttered tea, which they poured into my mouth
carelessly out of the <i>raksang</i>.</p>

<p>Mansing, whose religion did not allow him to eat food
touched by folk of a different caste, was eventually permitted
to lick the meal out of the wooden bowl. I myself
was none too proud to take the food in any way it might
be offered, and when my humble &quot;<i>Orcheh, orcheh tchuen
mangbo terokchi</i>&quot; (&quot;Please give me some more&quot;) met with
the disapproval of the Lamas, and brought out the everlasting
negative, &quot;<i>Midd&ugrave;, midd&ugrave;</i>,&quot; I was still too hungry to
waste any of the precious food: so the Tibetans revolved
the wooden bowl round and round my mouth, and I licked
it as clean as if it had never been used.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_LXXXVII" id="CHAPTER_LXXXVII"></a>CHAPTER LXXXVII</h2>

<h5>Happiness checked&mdash;Stretched on the rack&mdash;Mansing shares
my fate&mdash;Drenched and in rags&mdash;An unsolved mystery.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> all the excitement of the day, we were beginning to
feel a little restored and much relieved at being treated
rather less roughly, were it only for a few moments, when,
small as it was, the improvement in our condition was
checked.</p>

<p>A Lama came from the monastery and gave orders right
and left, and the place was again in commotion. We were
pounced upon and roughly seized, and my legs were quickly
untied, a number of men holding me down the while.
Again they lifted me until I stood upright on the cutting
edge of the prismatic log: two men seized one leg and two
the other, and stretched them apart as far as they could
possibly go. Then rope after rope was wound round my
feet and ankles, and I was made fast as before to the log.</p>

<p>As my legs were much farther apart this time, the pain in
the muscles of my legs when they proceeded to knock me
down backwards was even greater than it had been on the
previous occasion. But before I had time to feel it in full,
the Lamas, now as ferocious as I had seen them at first,
dragged my manacled arms backwards from under my body
and tied a rope to the chain of the handcuffs. This done,
they passed the rope through a hole in the top of a high
post behind me, and by tugging at it, strained my arms upwards
in a way that, had I been less supple, would certainly
have broken them. When all their strength combined could
not stretch me another inch without tearing my body to
pieces, they made the rope fast, and I remained half suspended,
and feeling as if all the bones of my limbs were
getting, or had got, pulled out of their sockets. The weight
of the body naturally tending to settle down would, I felt,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_409" id="Pg_409"></a>[<a href="./images/409.png">409</a>]</span>
every moment increase the suffering of this terrible torture,
which was really a primitive form of the rack.</p>

<p>Mansing was likewise suspended on the other side, his
feet remaining tied to the log to which my own were
fastened, only not quite so wide apart.</p>

<p>The pain was at first intense, the tendons of the legs and
arms being dreadfully strained, and the spinal column bent
so as nearly to be broken in two. The shoulder-blades
forced into close contact, pressed the vertebr&aelig; inwards,
and caused excruciating pains along the lumbar vertebr&aelig;,
where the strain was greatest.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Thus Elapsed Twenty-four terrible Hours</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>As if this were not sufficient, a cord was tied from Mansing's
neck to mine, the object of which was to keep our
necks stretched in a most uncomfortable position.</p>

<p>It began to rain heavily, and we were left out in the open.
The rags to which our clothes had been reduced in our
struggle when we were first seized were drenched. Half
naked and wounded, we were alternately numbed with cold
and burning with fever. A guard encircled us, having with
them two watch-dogs tied to pegs. The soldiers were
apparently so confident of our inability to escape that they
drew their heavy blankets over their heads and slept. One
of them in his slumber moved and pushed his sword outside
the blanket in which he had now rolled himself tight.
This inspired me with the idea of attempting to escape.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_410" id="Pg_410"></a>[<a href="./images/410.png">410</a>]</span>
Two or three hours later it had become very dark.
Thanks to the extremely supple nature of my hands, I succeeded
in drawing the right hand out of my handcuffs, and,
after an hour or so of stealthy and anxious work I managed
to unloose the cord that bound Mansing's feet. Then I
whispered to him to get up slowly and to push the sword
towards me with his foot until I could reach it. If successful
in this, I could soon cut my bonds and those fastening
Mansing's hands, and with a weapon in our possession we
would make a bold dash for liberty.</p>

<p>Mansing, however, was not a champion of agility. In
his joy at feeling partly free, the poor coolie moved his stiff
legs clumsily. The vigilant watch-dogs detected this, and
gave the alarm by barking. The guards were up in a
moment, and, timid as they always were, they all hurriedly
left us, and went to fetch lights to examine our bonds.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, protected by the darkness of the stormy
night, I had succeeded in replacing my hand inside the iron
handcuff. Putting it back was more difficult than drawing
it out, but I had just time to effect my purpose. The
men who had gone to the monastery returned with lights.
I pretended to be fast asleep: a likely thing with every bone
in my body feeling as if it were disjointed, every limb half-numbed
and frozen, every tendon and ligament so strained
as to drive me mad with pain!</p>

<p>The Tibetans found the bonds round Mansing's feet
undone. They examined my hands and saw them just as
they had left them. They inspected my feet. The ropes
were still there cutting into my flesh. They inspected
Mansing's hands, only to find them still fastened to the post
behind him.</p>

<p>The Tibetans were so puzzled at this mysterious occurrence
that they positively got frightened. They began to
shout excitedly, calling for help. In a moment, the alarm
having been given, a crowd of men rushed at us, and with
their swords drawn, surrounded us. One man, braver than
the rest, gave Mansing a few cuts with a whip, warning us
that if the ropes were found undone again they would decapitate
us there and then. The coolie was again bound,
this time more tightly than ever.</p>

<h5>Mansing partially untied after twelve hours on the rack&mdash;Numbed&mdash;How
the brain works under such circumstances&mdash;My
scientific instruments&mdash;The end of my photographic plates&mdash;A
paint-box accused of occult powers&mdash;An offer refused&mdash;Courtesy
and cruelty combined.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">By</span> way of precaution, a light was set between Mansing and
myself, and, as it was still raining hard, the Tibetans placed
a canvas shelter over us to prevent the light from being
extinguished. At about six or seven in the morning, Mansing's
feet were untied, but not his hands. I was left in the
same uncomfortable and painful posture. The hours passed
very slowly and wearily. My legs, my arms and hands had
gradually become quite lifeless, and after the first six or
seven hours that I had been stretched on the rack, I felt no
more actual pain. The numbness crept along every limb of
my body, until I had now the peculiar sensation of possessing
a living head on a dead body.</p>

<p>It is indeed remarkable how one's brain keeps alive and
working well under such circumstances, apparently unaffected
by the temporary mortification of the remainder of the system.</p>

<p>The day now dawning was one full of strange incidents.
When the sun was high in the sky, the Pombo, with a
great number of Lamas, rode down from the monastery,
though the distance was very short. He went to his tent,
and presently my cases of scientific instruments were
brought outside and opened, the soldiers and Lamas displaying
an amusing mixture of curiosity and caution over
everything they touched. I had to explain the use of each
instrument, a difficult matter indeed, considering their
ignorance and my limited knowledge of Tibetan, which did
not allow of my delivering scientific addresses. The sextant
was looked upon with great suspicion, and even more so the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_412" id="Pg_412"></a>[<a href="./images/412.png">412</a>]</span>
hypsometrical apparatus, with its thermometers in brass
tubes, which they took to be some sort of firearm, Then
came a lot of undeveloped photographic plates, box after
box of which they opened in broad daylight, destroying in a
few moments all the valuable negatives that I had taken
since leaving Mansarowar. The Pombo, more observant
than the others, noticed that the plates turned a yellowish
colour on being exposed to the light.</p>

<p>&quot;Why is that?&quot; asked he.</p>

<p>&quot;It is a sign that you will suffer for what you are doing to me.&quot;</p>

<p>The Pombo flung away the plate, and was much upset.
He ordered a hole to be dug in the ground some way off,
and the plates to be instantly buried. The soldiers, however,
who had been entrusted with the order, seemed loth
to touch the plates, and they had to be reprimanded and
beaten by the Lamas before they would obey. At last, with
their feet, they shoved the boxes of negatives to a spot some
distance off, where, in dog fashion, they dug a deep hole
with their hands in the muddy ground; and there, alas!
my work of several weeks was covered for ever with earth.</p>

<p>Now came my paint-box with its cakes of water-colours.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you do with these?&quot; cried an angry Lama,
pointing at the harmless colours.</p>

<p>&quot;I paint pictures.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, you are lying. With the 'yellow' you find where
gold is in the country, and with the 'blue' you discover
where malachite is.&quot;</p>

<p>I assured them that this was not the case, and told them
that, if they would untie me, I would, on recovering the use
of my arms, paint a picture before them.</p>

<p>They prudently preferred to leave me tied up.</p>

<p>Their whole attention was now drawn to a considerable
sum in silver and gold which they found in the cases, and
the Pombo warned the people that not one coin must be stolen.</p>

<p>I took this chance to make an offering of 500 rupees to
the lamasery, and told the Pombo that I would like him to
accept as a gift my Martini-Henry, which I had noticed
rather took his fancy.</p>

<p>Both gifts were refused, as they said the lamasery was very
wealthy, and the Pombo's position as an official did not allow
him to carry a rifle. The Pombo, nevertheless, was quite
touched by the offer, and came personally to thank me.</p>

<p>In a way the rascals were gentlemanly enough in their
manner, and I could not help admiring their mixture of
courtesy and cruelty, either of which they could switch on
at a moment's notice without regard to the other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had now reached the bottom of the water-tight case,

flattened object.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that?&quot; inquired he, as usual lifting the article
up in the air.</p>

<p>My sight had been so injured that I could not clearly
discern what it was; but on their waving it in front of my
nose, I recognised it to be my long mislaid bath-sponge,
dry and flattened, which Chanden Sing, with his usual
ability for packing, had stored away at the bottom of the
case, piling upon it the heavy cases of photographic plates.
The sponge, a very large one, was now reduced to the thickness
of less than an inch, owing to the weight that had for
weeks lain upon it.</p>

<p>The Tibetans were greatly puzzled at this new discovery,
which they said resembled tinder; and it was
touched with much caution, for some of the Lamas said it
might explode.</p>

<p>When their curiosity was appeased, they took it and threw
it away. It fell near me in a small pool of water. This was
a golden opportunity to frighten my jailers, and I addressed
the sponge in English, and with any word that came into my
mouth, pretending to utter incantations. The attention of
the Lamas and soldiers was naturally quickly drawn to
this unusual behaviour on my part; and they could not
conceal their terror when, as I spoke louder and louder to
the sponge, it gradually swelled to its normal size with the
moisture it absorbed.</p>

<p>The Tibetans, who at first could hardly believe their
eyes at this incomprehensible occurrence, became so panic-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_414" id="Pg_414"></a>[<a href="./images/414.png">414</a>]</span>stricken
at what they believed to be an exhibition of my
occult powers, that there was a general stampede in every
direction.</p>

<p>In a way, all this was entertaining, and anyhow it served
to pass away the time. The most amusing scene that afternoon
was, however, still to come.</p>

<p>After a time the Lamas screwed up their courage, and
returned to where my baggage had been overhauled. One
of them picked up my Martini-Henry, and the others urged
him to fire it off. He came to me, and when I had explained
to him how to load it, he took a cartridge and placed it in
the breech, but would insist on not closing the bolt firmly
home. When I warned him of the consequences, he struck
me over the head with the butt of the rifle.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Belt, with Bullet and Powder Pouches, Dagger, Needle-case, and Flint and Steel</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>It is the fashion, when aiming with one of their matchlocks,
which have a prop attached to them, to place the butt
in front of the nose instead of holding it firmly to the
shoulder as we do. So the Lama aimed in this fashion at
one of my yaks peacefully grazing some thirty yards off.
While everybody watched anxiously to see the results of
this marksman's shooting, he pulled the trigger; the rifle
went off with an extra loud report, and behold! the muzzle
of the Martini burst and the violent recoil gave the Lama a
fearful blow in the face. The rifle, flying out of his hands,
described a somersault in the air, and the Lama fell backwards
to the ground, where he remained spread out flat,
bleeding all over, and screaming like a child. His nose was
squashed; one eye had been put out, and his teeth shattered.</p>

<p>Whether the rifle burst because the bolt had not been
properly closed, or because mud had got into the muzzle as
well, I could not say; but I give here a photograph of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_415" id="Pg_415"></a>[<a href="./images/415.png">415</a>]</span>
broken weapon, which the Tibetans returned to me several
months later through the Government of India.</p>

<p>The injured Lama, I may say, was the one at the head of
the party that wanted to have my head cut off, so that,
naturally enough, I could not help betraying my satisfaction
at the accident. I was glad they had let me live another
day were it only to see his self-inflicted punishment.</p>

<h5>A consultation&mdash;Untied from the rack&mdash;The most terrible
twenty-four hours of my life&mdash;I lose the use of my feet&mdash;Circulation
returning&mdash;Intense pain&mdash;Sports.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pombo, who had been, during the greater part of the
afternoon, looking at me with an air of mingled pity and
respect, as though he had been forced against his will to
treat me so brutally, could not help joining in my laughter
at the Lama's sorrowful plight. In a way, I believe he was
rather glad that the accident had happened; for, if he had
until then been uncertain whether to kill me or not, he felt,
after what had occurred, that it was not prudent to attempt
it. The gold ring which had been taken from me on the day
of our arrest, and for which I had asked many times, as it
had been given by my mother, was regarded as possessing
miraculous powers as long as it was upon me; and was
therefore kept well away from me, for fear that, with its
help, I might break my bonds and escape. The Pombo,
the Lamas and officers held another consultation, at the
end of which, towards sunset, several soldiers came and
loosed my legs from the stretching log; and my hands,
though still manacled, were lowered from the pillar behind.</p>

<p>As the ropes round my ankles were unwound from the
deep channels they had cut into my flesh, large patches of
skin came away with them. Thus ended the most terrible
twenty-four hours I have ever passed in my lifetime.</p>

<p>I felt very little relief at first as I lay flat on the ground,
for my body and legs were stiff and as if dead; and, as time
went by, and I saw no signs of their coming back to life, I
feared that mortification had set in, and that I had lost the
use of my feet for good. It was two or three hours before
the blood began to circulate in my right foot, and the pain
when it did so was intense. Had a handful of knives been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_417" id="Pg_417"></a>[<a href="./images/417.png">417</a>]</span>
passed slowly down the inside of my leg the agony could
not have been more excruciating. My arms were not quite
so bad: they also were numbed, but the circulation was
more quickly re-established.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, the Pombo, whether to amuse me or
to show off his riches, ordered about one hundred ponies,
some with magnificent harness, to be brought up; and,
mounting the finest, and holding in his hand that dreadful
<i>taram</i>, rode round the hill on which the monastery and fort
stood.</p>

<p>On returning, he harangued his men, and a series of sports
began, the Pombo seating himself near me and watching me
intently to see how I was enjoying the performance. First
of all the best marksmen were selected, and with their
matchlocks fired one after the other at my two poor yaks
only a few yards off; but although they aimed carefully and
deliberately, they did not succeed in hitting them. I knew
that they fired with bullets, for I could hear the hissing
sound the missiles made.</p>

<p>Next came a display of fine horsemanship, which was very
interesting. I should have enjoyed it more if I had not been
suffering agonies all the time. Still, the performance helped
to cheer me. First there were races in which only two
ponies at a time took part, the last race being run between
the two winners of the last heats, and a <i>kata</i> was presented
to the victor. Next one horseman rode ahead at full gallop
flying a <i>kata</i>, while some twenty others followed closely
behind. The <i>kata</i> was left to fly by itself, and when it
settled on the ground, the horsemen following the first rode
some distance away, and, at a given signal, galloped back
wildly, all converging towards the spot, and, bending down
from their ponies, attempted to pick up the <i>kata</i> without
dismounting. Some of the younger men were very clever
at this.</p>

<p>Another exercise consisted in one man on foot standing
still, while a mounted comrade rode at full gallop towards
him, seized him by his clothes, and lifted him on to the
saddle.</p>

<p>Though I could not see as well as I wished, I got so
interested in the show, and expressed such admiration for
the ponies, that the Pombo, becoming quite thoughtful and
polite, ordered the best of them to be brought before me,
and had me lifted into a sitting posture, so that I could see
them better.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XCI" id="CHAPTER_XCI"></a>CHAPTER XCI</h2>

<h5>A great relief&mdash;The Pombo's attentions&mdash;A weird hypnotic
dance.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was a great relief, for I was suffering more from my
humiliating position, being unable to stand, than from
the tortures themselves. The Pombo told me that I must
now look towards the tent, and then got up and walked
towards it.</p>

<p>The opening of the tent was over twenty feet long. Some
soldiers came and dragged me close to the front of it, so that
I could witness all that went on.</p>

<p>Two big Lamas entered the tent with the Pombo, and a
number of other people who were inside were turned out.
They closed the tent for a few minutes, and then opened it
again. In the meantime a gong summoned the Lamas of
the monastery to come down, and, a few minutes later, a
string of them came and took their places inside the
tent.</p>

<p>The Pombo, in his yellow coat and trousers and four-cornered
hat, sat on a kind of high-backed chair in the centre
of the tent, and by his side stood the two Lamas who had
first entered it with him. The Pombo was beyond doubt in
a hypnotic trance. He sat motionless, with his hands flat on
his knees and his head erect; his eyes were fixed and
staring. For some minutes he remained like this, and all
the soldiers and people who had collected in front of the
tent went down on their knees, laid their caps on the
ground, and muttered prayers. One of the two Lamas, a
fellow with great mesmeric powers, now laid his hand upon
the shoulders of the Pombo, who gradually raised his arms
with hands outstretched and remained as in a cataleptic state
for a long time without moving an inch.</p>

<p>Next the Lama touched the Pombo's neck with his thumbs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_419" id="Pg_419"></a>[<a href="./images/419.png">419</a>]</span>
and caused the head to begin a rapid circular movement
from left to right.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<p class="figcenter">The Pombo's Contortions</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>Certain exorcisms were pronounced by the hypnotiser,
and the Pombo now began the most extraordinary snake-like
contortions, moving and twisting his arms, head, body and
legs. He worked himself, or rather was worked, into a frenzy
that lasted some time, and the crowd of devotees drew nearer
and nearer to him, praying fervently and emitting deep sighs
and cries of astonishment and almost terror at some of the
more eccentric movements of his limbs. Every now and then
this weird kind of dance terminated in a strange posture,
the Pombo actually doubling himself up with his head
between his feet and his long flat hat resting on the ground.
While he was in this position, the bystanders went one by
one to finger his feet, and make low prostrations and
salaams. At last the hypnotiser, seizing the Pombo's head
between his hands, stared in his eyes, rubbed his forehead,
and woke him from the trance. The Pombo
was pale and exhausted. He lay back on the chair and
his hat fell off his head, which was clean shaven, thus
unmistakably showing that he too was a Lama, and, as we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_420" id="Pg_420"></a>[<a href="./images/420.png">420</a>]</span>
have seen, of a very high order, probably of the first rank
after the Dalai Lama.</p>

<p><i>Katas</i> were distributed after this religious performance to
all the Tibetans present, and they folded them and stowed
them away in their coats.</p>

<h5>Compliments exchanged&mdash;A poisoned drink proffered&mdash;In
acute pain&mdash;Uncertainty as to our fate&mdash;Working the oracle&mdash;My webbed
fingers.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pombo came out of his gaudy tent, and I told him that
the dance was beautiful, but that I was very hungry. He
asked me what I wanted to eat, and I said I would like some
meat and tea.</p>

<p>A little later, a large vessel with a delicious stew of yak's
meat was brought to me, as well as <i>tsamba</i> in abundance.
However, though I felt quite famished, I had the greatest
difficulty in swallowing even a little food. This I thought
must be owing to the injuries to my spine and to the
mortification of my limbs, which had apparently affected my
whole system except my head.</p>

<p>When the Pombo had retired and night came on, I was
again tied to the stretching log, but this time with my limbs
not stretched so far apart. My hands, too, were again
fastened to the pillar behind, but with no strain on them.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, half a dozen Lamas came from the
monastery with a light and a large brass bowl which they
said contained tea. The wounded Lama, with his head all
bandaged up, was among them, and he was so anxious for
me to drink some of it to keep myself warm during the cold
night that I became suspicious. When they pushed a bowl
of the liquid to my lips, I merely sipped a little, and declined
to take more, spitting out what they had forced into my
mouth. I swallowed a few drops, and a few minutes later I
was seized with sharp, excruciating pains in my stomach,
which continued for several days after. I can but conclude
that the drink proffered me was poisoned.</p>

<p>The following day my left foot, which had remained lifeless
since I had been untied from the rack the first time,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_422" id="Pg_422"></a>[<a href="./images/422.png">422</a>]</span>
began to get better, and the circulation was gradually
restored. The pain was unbearable.</p>

<p>In the morning indecision again prevailed as to what was
to be done to us. A number of Lamas were still anxious to
have us beheaded, whereas the Pombo and the others had
the previous night almost made up their minds to send us
back to the frontier. Unfortunately, it appears<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> that the
Pombo had seen a vision during the night in which a spirit
told him that, if he did not kill us, he and his country would
suffer some great misfortune. &quot;You can kill the Plenki,&quot;
the spirit was reported to have said, &quot;and no one will punish
you if you do. The Plenkis are afraid to fight the
Tibetans.&quot;</p>

<p>Among the Lamas no important step is taken without
incantations and reference to occult science, so the Pombo
ordered a Lama to cut off a lock of my hair, which he did
with a very blunt knife, and then the Pombo rode up
with it in his hand to the lamasery to consult the oracle.
The lock was handed in for inspection, and it seems
that, after certain incantations, the oracle answered that I
must be beheaded or the country would be in great
danger.</p>

<p>The Pombo rode back apparently disappointed, and now
ordered that one of my toe-nails should be cut; after which
operation, performed with the same blunt knife, the oracle
was again consulted as to what should be done, and
unhappily gave the same answer.</p>

<p>Three such consultations are usually held by the high
court of the assembled Lamas, the Tibetans on the third
occasion producing for the oracle's decision a piece of a
finger-nail. The Lama who was about to cut this off
examined my hands behind and spread my fingers apart,
expressing great surprise and astonishment. In a moment
all the Lamas and soldiers came round and examined my
manacled hands; a repetition of my experience at the
Tucker Monastery. The Pombo, too, on being informed,
immediately came and inspected my fingers, and the proceedings
were at once stopped.</p>

<p>When some weeks later I was released, I was able to learn
from the Tibetans the reason of their amazement. My
fingers happen to be webbed rather higher than usual, and
this is most highly thought of in Tibet. He who possesses
such fingers has, according to the Tibetans, a charmed life;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_423" id="Pg_423"></a>[<a href="./images/423.png">423</a>]</span>
and no matter how much one tries, no harm can be done
to him. Apart from the question whether there was much
charm or not in my life in Tibet, there is no doubt that this
trifling superstition did much towards hastening the Pombo's
decision as to what was to be our fate.</p>

<h5>Our lives to be spared&mdash;An unpleasant march&mdash;Chanden Sing
still alive&mdash;A sleepless night&mdash;Towards the frontier&mdash;Long
and painful marches&mdash;How we slept at night&mdash;A map drawn
with blood.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Pombo ordered that my life should be spared, and that
I should on that very day start on my return journey
towards the Indian frontier. He took from my own money
one hundred and twenty rupees, which he placed in my
pocket for my wants during the journey, and commanded
that, though I must be kept chained up, I was to be treated
kindly, and my servants also.</p>

<p>When all was ready, Mansing and I were led on foot to
Toxem, our guard consisting of some fifty horsemen riding
on ponies. We had to travel at a great speed despite our
severely lacerated feet, our aching bones, and the sores and
wounds with which we were covered all over. The soldiers
led me tied by the neck like a dog, and dragged me along
when, panting, exhausted and suffering, I could not keep up
with the ponies. We crossed several cold streams, sinking
in water and mud up to our waists.</p>

<p>At Toxem, to my great delight, I beheld Chanden Sing
still alive. He had been kept prisoner in the mud-house,
where he had remained tied upright to a post for over three
days, and for four days he had not eaten food nor drunk anything.
He was told that I had been beheaded. He was in a
dreadful condition; almost dying from his wounds, cold and
starvation.</p>

<p>We were detained there for the night, half-choked by
smoke in one of the rooms of the mud-house packed with
soldiers, who, with a woman of easy morals, gambled the
whole night, and sang and swore and fought, preventing
us from sleeping for even a few minutes.</p>

on yaks, not on riding saddles, but on pack-saddles such
as those shown in the illustration in chapter xl. <a href="#Pg_223">p. 223</a>.
Poor Mansing was made to walk, and was beaten mercilessly
when, tired and worn out, he fell or remained
behind. They again tied him with a rope by the neck and
dragged him along in a most brutal manner. We had a
strong guard to prevent our escaping, and they demanded
fresh relays of yaks and ponies and food for themselves at
all the encampments, so that we travelled very fast. In the
first five days we covered one hundred and seventy-eight
miles, the two longest marches being respectively forty-two
and forty-five miles; but afterwards we did not cover quite
such great distances.</p>

<p>We suffered considerably on these long marches, as the
soldiers ill-treated us and would not allow us to eat every
day for fear we should get too strong. They let us have
food only every two or three days, and our exhaustion and
the pain caused by riding those wretched yaks in our
wounded condition were terrible.</p>

<p>All our property had been taken away from us, and our
clothes were in rags and swarming with vermin. We were</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_428" id="Pg_428"></a>[<a href="./images/428.png">428</a>]</span>
bare-footed and practically naked. The first few days we
generally marched from before sunrise till sometimes an
hour or two after sunset; and when we reached camp we
were torn off our yaks and our jailers fastened iron cuffs
round our ankles, in addition to those we had already round
our wrists. Being considered quite safe, we were left to
sleep out in the open without a covering of any kind, and
often lying on snow or deluged with rain. Our guard
generally pitched a tent under which they slept; but even
when they did not have one, they usually went to brew their
tea some fifty yards or so from us.</p>

<p>Helped by my two servants, who sat by me to keep watch
and to screen me, I managed, at considerable risk, to keep a
rough record of the journey back, on a small piece of paper
that had remained in my pocket when I had been searched
by the Tibetans. As I did when on the rack, I used to draw
my right hand out of its cuff, and, with a small piece of bone
I had picked up as pen, and my blood as ink, I drew brief
cipher notes, and a map of the whole route back.</p>

<p>Necessarily, as I had no instruments with which to take
careful observations, I had to content myself with taking my
bearings by the sun, the position of which I got fairly
accurately by constantly watching the shadow projected by
my body on the ground. Of course, when it rained or
snowed, I was altogether at a loss, and had to reckon my
bearings by the observations of the previous day.</p>

<h5>South of the outward journey&mdash;Severity of our guard&mdash;Ventriloquism
and its effects&mdash;Terrible but instructive days&mdash;The
Southern source of the Brahmaputra&mdash;Leaving Yutzang.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> travelled, as can be seen by the dotted red line on the
map attached to this book, first W. then W.N.W., N.W., W.
and N.W., following the Brahmaputra along a course South
of the outward journey, until we reached the boundary
of the Yutzang<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> (central, or Lhassa) province. Our guard
were not only severe with us, but they also ill-treated us in
every possible way. One or two of the soldiers, however,
showed kindness and thoughtfulness, bringing us a little
butter or <i>tsamba</i> whenever they could do so unseen by their
comrades. The guard was changed so frequently that we
had no chance of making friends with them, and each lot
seemed worse than the last.</p>

<p>A very curious incident happened one day, causing a
scare among them. We had halted near a cliff, and the
soldiers were some twenty yards off. Having exhausted
every means I could think of to inspire these ruffians with
respect, I resorted to the performance of some ventriloquial
feats, pretending to speak and to receive the answers from
the summit of the cliff. The Tibetans were terror-stricken.
They asked me who was up there. I said it was some one
I knew.</p>

<p>&quot;Is it a Plenki?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately they hustled us on our yaks and mounted
their ponies, and we left the place at headlong speed.</p>

<p>On reaching a spot which from observations taken on my
outward journey I reckoned to be in longitude 83&deg; 6&#8242; 30&#8243; E.
and latitude 30&deg; 27&#8242; 30&#8243; N. I had a great piece of luck.
It is at this point that the two principal sources of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_430" id="Pg_430"></a>[<a href="./images/430.png">430</a>]</span>
Brahmaputra meet and form one river, the one coming from
the N.W., which I had already followed, the other proceeding
from the W.N.W. The Tibetans, to my delight, selected
the southern route, thus giving me the opportunity of visiting
the second of the two principal sources of the great river.
This second stream rises in a flat plain, having its first birth
in a lakelet in approximate longitude
82&deg; 47&#8242; E. and latitude 30&deg;
33&#8242; N. I gave the Northern source
my own name, a proceeding which
I trust will not be regarded as
immodest in view of the fact that I was the first European to
visit both sources and of all the circumstances of my journey.</p>

<p>This period of our captivity was dreary, yet interesting
and instructive, for, as we went along, I got the soldiers to
teach me some Tibetan songs, not unlike those of the Shokas
in character, and from the less ill-natured men of our guard
I picked up, by judicious questioning, a considerable amount
of information, which, together with that collected from my
own observations, I have given in this book.</p>

<p>Over a more southerly and lower pass than the Maium
Pass, by which, healthy, hopeful and free, we had entered
the province of Yutzang, we now left it, wounded, broken

<h5>Easier times&mdash;Large encampments&mdash;Suffocating a goat&mdash;A
Tarjum's encampment&mdash;Tokchim&mdash;Old friends&mdash;Musicians&mdash;Charity.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now proceeded in a North-westerly direction, and, once
clear of the sacred Yutzang province, our guard behaved
with rather less cruelty. With the little money the Pombo
had permitted me to keep we were allowed to purchase
food enough to provide us with more frequent meals, and,
while we ate, the soldiers removed our handcuffs, which
they temporarily placed round our ankles. Thus, with
utensils lent us by our guard, we were able to cook some
food; and, although we had to serve it on flat stones instead
of dishes, it seemed indeed delicious.</p>

<p>We crossed over our former track, and then followed it
almost in a parallel line, but some miles North of it, along an
undulating, clayey plateau, thus avoiding the marshy plain
which we had found so troublesome to cross on our journey
out. We found large numbers of black tents here and
there, and one night, when we were encamped by some
small lakes, we were permitted to purchase a goat. A
soldier, a good fellow who had been very friendly to us,
selected a fine fat one for us, and we were looking forward
with pleasure to a solid meal, when we found to our dismay
that we had no means of despatching the animal. We could
not behead it, as the Tibetans would not trust us with a
knife or sword, and the Tibetans themselves refused to kill
the animal for us in any other way. Eventually our soldier
friend allowed his scruples to be overcome by the payment
of a rupee, and proceeded to kill the animal in a most cruel
fashion. He tied its legs together, and, having stuffed the
nostrils with mud, he held the poor beast's mouth closed
with one hand until it was suffocated. The soldier during
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_432" id="Pg_432"></a>[<a href="./images/432.png">432</a>]</span>
the performance revolved his prayer-wheel with his free
hand, praying fervently all the while.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>We found ourselves at last in the plain, where a Tarjum's
encampment of some two hundred tents was to be seen, and
here we remained one night. There was a large assemblage
of Lamas and soldiers. In the middle of the night we were
suddenly and roughly roused from sleep, and made to
move our camp about a mile or so from the settlement;
and, early in the morning, having crossed the large stream,
we proceeded in a South-westerly direction, reaching the
encampment of the Tokchim Tarjum the same night. Here
we were met by the officers who had on a previous occasion
brought us gifts, and whom we had routed with all their
soldiers when they threatened us.</p>

<p>This time they behaved very decently, the oldest of them
showing us every civility, and professing great admiration
for our courage in persevering against such heavy odds. The
old gentleman did all he could to make us comfortable, and
even called up two strolling musicians for our amusement.
One man wore a peculiar four-cornered head-dress made of
skin. He played with a bow on a two-stringed instrument,
while his companion, a child, danced and went through</p>

certain clumsy contortions, going round every few minutes
with his tongue thrust out to beg for <i>tsamba</i> from the
audience. The Tibetans are very charitable towards
beggars, and not only on this, but on other occasions, I
noticed that they seldom refused, no matter however small
their donations might be, to give <i>tsamba</i> or pieces of butter or
<i>chura</i> to the mendicants. The older musician had a square
club passed through his girdle, and at intervals he laid down
his instrument, and, using the club as a sword, gave an
imitation of a martial dance, exactly like the one I have
described as performed by the Shokas. Every now and
then, too, he applied it to the boy's back and head, to
inspire him with fresh vigour, and this generally drew roars
of laughter from the audience.</p>

<h5>Towards Mansarowar&mdash;Mansing's vision&mdash;Bathing in
Mansarowar.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, amidst repeated good-byes and professions of
friendship on the part of our hosts and jailers, we departed
towards Mansarowar, and late in the afternoon reached the
Tucker village and Gomba, where we put up at the same
<i>serai</i> in which I had slept on my way out. All our bonds
were here removed for good, and we enjoyed comparative
freedom, though four men walked by my side wherever I
went, and an equal number looked after Chanden Sing and
Mansing. Naturally we were not allowed to go far from the
<i>serai</i>, but we could prowl about in the village. I took this
opportunity to have a swim in the Mansarowar Lake, and
Chanden Sing and Mansing again paid fresh salaams to the
gods and plunged in the sacred water.</p>

<p>The Lamas, who had been so friendly during my former
visit, were now extremely sulky and rude; and, after having
witnessed our arrival, they all withdrew into the monastery,
banging the gate after them. All the villagers, too, hastily
retired to their respective houses. The place was deserted
with the exception of the soldiers round us.</p>

<p>Poor Mansing, who, worn out and in great pain, was
sitting close by me, looking vaguely at the lake, had an
extraordinary vision, the result, probably, of fever or exhaustion.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, sahib,&quot; said he, as if in a dream, though he was
quite awake; &quot;look, look! Look at the crowd of people
walking on the water. There must be more than a thousand
men! Oh, how big they are getting!... And there is God ... Seva.... No,
they are Tibetans, they are coming to
kill us, they are Lamas! Oh, come, sahib, they are so near.... Oh,
they are flying...!&quot;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_436" id="Pg_436"></a>[<a href="./images/436.png">436</a>]</span>&quot;Where are they?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>I could see that the poor fellow was under an hallucination. His forehead
was burning and he was in a high fever.</p>

<p>&quot;They have all disappeared!&quot; he exclaimed, as I placed my hand
on his forehead and he woke from his trance.</p>

<p>He seemed quite stupefied for a few moments; and, on my inquiring of him
later whether he had seen the phantom crowd again, he could not remember
ever having seen it at all.</p>

<p>The natives came to visit us in the <i>serai</i> during the evening, and we
had great fun with them, for the Tibetans are full of humour and have
many comical ways. As for ourselves, now that we were only two marches
from Taklakot, it was but natural that our spirits were high. Only two
more days of captivity, and then a prospect of freedom.</p>

<p>It was still dark when we were roused and ordered to
start. The soldiers dragged us out of the <i>serai</i>. We
entreated them to let us have another plunge in the
sacred Mansarowar, and the three of us were eventually
allowed to do so. The water was bitterly cold, and we had
nothing to dry ourselves with.</p>

<p>It was about an hour before sunrise when we were
placed on our yaks and, surrounded by some thirty soldiers,
rode off.</p>

Tea Churn (Open)</div>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> we had been marching for several hours, our guard halted to have
their tea. A man named Suna, and his brother and son, whom I had met in
Garbyang, halted near us, and from them I heard that news had arrived in
India that I and my two men had been beheaded, and that thereupon Doctor
Wilson and the Political Peshkar Karak Sing had crossed over the frontier
to ascertain the facts, and to attempt to recover my baggage, &amp;c. My
joy was intense when I heard that they were still at Taklakot. I
persuaded Suna to return as fast as he could, and to inform Wilson that I
was a prisoner, and tell him my whereabouts. I had barely given Suna this
message when our guard seized the man and his brother and roughly
dismissed them, preventing them from having any further communication
with us. As soon as we were on the march again, a horseman rode up to us
with strict orders from the Jong Pen of Taklakot not to let us proceed
any farther towards the frontier by the Lippu Pass, which we could now
have reached in two days, but to take us round by the distant Lumpiya
Pass. At this time of the year the Lumpiya would be impassable; and we
should have to make a further journey of at least fifteen or sixteen
days, most of it over snow and ice, during which we, in our
starved and weakened state, would inevitably succumb.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_439" id="Pg_439"></a>[<a href="./images/439.png">439</a>]</span>
We asked to be taken into Taklakot, but our guard refused,
and in the meantime the Jong Pen of Taklakot had sent
other messengers and soldiers to ensure the fulfilment of his
orders, and to prevent our further progress.</p></div>

<p>Our guard, now strengthened by the Taklakot men, compelled us to leave
the Taklakot track, and we began our journey towards the cold Lumpiya.
This was murder, and the Tibetans, well knowing it, calculated on telling
the Indian authorities that we had died a natural death on the snows.</p>

<p class="figcenter">

<img src="./images/439_th.jpg" alt="A Bearer of Bad News" title="A Bearer of Bad News" /></a></p>
<p class="figcenter">A Bearer of Bad News</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>We were informed that we should be left at the point where the snows
began, that the Tibetans would give us no food, no clothes and no
blankets, and that we should be abandoned to our own devices. This,
needless to say, meant certain death.</p>

<p>We determined to stand no more, and to play our last
card. After travelling some two and a half miles westward
of the Taklakot track, we declined to proceed any more in
that direction. We said that, if they attempted to force us
on, we were prepared to fight our guard, as whether we
died by their swords and matchlocks, or frozen to death
on the Lumpiya, was quite immaterial to us.</p>

<p>The guard, in perplexity, decided to let us halt there for
the night, so as to have time to send a messenger to
Taklakot to inform the Jong Pen, and ask for further
instructions.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>During the night the order came that we must proceed,
so the next morning our guard prepared to start us again
towards the Lumpiya. Then we three semi-corpses collected
what little strength remained in us, and suddenly made an
attack on them with stones; whereupon, incredible as it
may seem, our cowardly guard turned tail and bolted! We
went on in the direction of Taklakot, followed at a distance
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_441" id="Pg_441"></a>[<a href="./images/441.png">441</a>]</span>
by these ruffians, who were entreating us to make no
further resistance and to go with them where they wanted
us to go. If we did not, they said, they would all have their
heads cut off. We refused to listen to them, and kept them
away by throwing stones at them.</p>

Sheep Loads for Borax and Grain</div>
<p>We had gone but a few miles when we met with a large force of soldiers
and Lamas, despatched by the Jong Pen to prepare for our death. Unarmed,
wounded, starved and exhausted as we were, it was useless attempting to
fight against such odds. As it was, when they saw we were at liberty,
they made ready to fire on us.</p>

<p>The Jong Pen's Chief Minister, a man called Lapsang, and the Jong Pen's
Private Secretary, were at the head of this party. I went to shake hands
with them and held a long and stormy palaver, but they kept firm and
insisted on our turning away from the frontier, now that we were almost
within a stone's-throw of it, and we must perforce proceed by the high
Lumpiya Pass. Those were the Jong Pen's orders, and they, as well as I,
must obey them. They would not give us or sell us either animals or
clothes which even the small sum of money I had on me would have been
sufficient to buy; and they would not provide us with an ounce of food.
We emphatically protested, and said we preferred to die where we were. We
asked them to kill us then and there, for we would not budge an inch
westwards.</p>

<p>Lapsang and the Jong Pen's Private Secretary now cunningly
suggested that I should give them in writing the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_442" id="Pg_442"></a>[<a href="./images/442.png">442</a>]</span>
names of the Shokas who had accompanied me to Tibet,
probably with the object of confiscating their land and
goods. As I said I could not write Tibetan or Hindustani,
they requested me to do it in English. This I did, but
substituting for the names of my men and my signature
sarcastic remarks, which must have caused the Tibetans
some surprise when they had the document translated.</p></div>

<p>As, however, they refused to kill us there and then, and as
Lapsang showed us great politeness and asked us to go by
the Lumpiya Pass as a personal favour to him, I reluctantly
decided to accept their terms rather than waste any more
time, now that we were so near British soil.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Escorted by this large force of men, we had nearly reached
Kardam when, in the nick of time, a horseman came up at
full gallop and hailed our party. We stopped, and the man
overtook us and handed Lapsang a letter. It contained an
order to bring us immediately into Taklakot.</p>

<p>We retraced our steps along the undulating plateau above
the Gakkon River, and late at night we reached the village
of Dogmar, a peculiar settlement in a valley between two
high cliffs of clay, the natives of which live in holes pierced
in the cliff.</p>

we were to slaughter the Jong Pen's soldiers&mdash;My
men lay down their arms&mdash;Towards Taklakot&mdash;Delaling and
Sibling&mdash;Taklakot at last.</h5>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the night there was a great commotion in the place,
the people running about and shouting, and a large number
of ponies with their riders arriving.</p>

<p>Tibet is farmed out, so to speak, to officials who have
become small feudal kings, and these are generally at logger-heads
among themselves. To this regal jealousy, and to
disputes over the rights of the road, was due the appearance
of this new army. There were altogether some hundred
and fifty men armed with matchlocks and swords. The
chieftain of this band came to me with eight or ten other
officers, and spoke so excitedly that I feared there was
trouble in store for us. There was indeed. These new
arrivals were officers and soldiers from Gyanema, Kardam,
and Barca, and they had come with strict orders from the
Barca Tarjum that we were on no account to traverse his
province or to cross by the Lumpiya Pass. This was very
amusing and tantalising, for we had now no way across the
frontier open to us. Our guard and some of the Jong Pen's
men who had remained behind, finding they were in the
minority, thought it prudent to eclipse themselves; and I,
anxious as I naturally was to get out of the country as
quickly as possible, approved of all that the Gyanema
men said, and urged them to fight in case the Jong Pen still
insisted on my going through the Tarjum's province. All
ways out of the country were barred to us, and unless we
resorted to force, I felt we would never escape at all.</p>

<p>The Gyanema men asked me whether I would lead them
in case of a fight with the Jong Pen's soldiers; and I, though
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_446" id="Pg_446"></a>[<a href="./images/446.png">446</a>]</span>
not very confident of their courage, accepted the post of
General-in-chief <i>pro tem.</i>, Chanden Sing and Mansing being promoted
there and then to be my aides-de-camp. We spent the greater part of the
night in arranging our plan of attack on the Jong Pen's troops, and when
all was properly settled, the Tibetans, to show their gratitude, brought
me a leg of mutton, some <i>tsamba</i>, and two bricks of tea.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>The morning came, and I was given a fine pony to ride, as were also
Chanden Sing and Mansing. Then, followed by my Tibetan troops&mdash;a
grand cavalcade&mdash;we started gaily towards Taklakot. We had been
informed that the Jong Pen was concentrating his men at a certain point
on the road to bar our way: and it was this point that we must force. My
Tibetans said that they hated the Jong Pen's men, and swore they would
slaughter them all if they made any stand.</p>

<p>&quot;But they are such cowards,&quot; declared one of the Tibetan
officers, &quot;that they will run away.&quot;</p>

<p>All this talk stopped suddenly when we heard the distant
tinkling of our enemies' horse-bells, and though I encouraged
my men as best I could, a panic began to spread
among them. The Jong Pen's men came in sight, and</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_448" id="Pg_448"></a>[<a href="./images/448.png">448</a>]</span>
presently I witnessed the strange spectacle of two armies
face to face, each in mortal terror of the other.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding my remonstrances, matchlocks and
swords were deposited on the ground with anxious eagerness
by both parties, to show that only peaceful intentions
prevailed. Then a conference was held, in which everybody
seemed ready to oblige everybody else except me.</p>

<p>While this was still proceeding, a horseman arrived with a
message from the Jong Pen, and at last, to everybody's satisfaction,
permission was granted for us to proceed into Taklakot.</p>

<p>My army retraced its steps towards the North-west, and,
deposed from my high military post, which I had occupied
only a few hours, I became again a private individual and a
prisoner. With a large escort we were taken along the
Gakkon, by barren cliffs and on a rocky road. We passed
hundreds of <i>Chokdens</i> large and small, mostly painted red, and
<i>mani</i> walls. Then, having descended by a precipitous track
on whitish clay-soil, we reached a thickly inhabited district,
where stone houses were scattered all over the landscape.
We saw on our left the large monastery of Delaling and, a
little way off, the Gomba of Sibling; then, describing a
sweeping curve among stones and boulders, we rounded the
high graceful cliff, on the top of which towered the fort and
monasteries of Taklakot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Such</span> was our anxiety, when we reached this point, lest
something should happen and we should be taken back again, that, as soon
as we were across the wooden bridge over the Gakkon, Chanden Sing and I,
on perceiving the large Shoka encampment at the foot of the hill, lashed
our ponies and ran away from our guard. Thus, galloping our hardest along
the high cliff, where hundreds of people live in holes in the clay, we
found ourselves at last among friends again. The Shokas, who had come
over to this market to exchange their goods with the Tibetans, were
astounded when they saw us, recognising us at first with difficulty.</p>

<p>We inquired at once, of course, for Dr. Wilson, and when we found him the
good man could, himself, barely recognise us, so changed were we. He
seemed deeply moved at seeing our condition.</p>

<p>When the news of our arrival spread in camp, we met
with the greatest kindness at the hands of everybody. In a
corner of Wilson's tent was a large quantity of candied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_451" id="Pg_451"></a>[<a href="./images/451.png">451</a>]</span>
sugar&mdash;several pounds; and so famished was I that I quickly
devoured the lot. Later, my Shoka friends brought in all
kinds of presents in the shape of eatables, which Rubso, the
Doctor's cook, was set to prepare.</p>

<p>The Political Peshkar, Karak Sing, hurried to me with a change of
clothes, and other garments were given me by Dr. Wilson. My own ragged
attire was literally swarming with vermin; our guard had not allowed us a
single change of raiment, nor would they even hear of our washing. It was
by a very special favour and on account of its sanctity that we were
allowed to plunge in the sacred Mansarowar Lake.</p>

<p>Later in the day my wounds and injuries were examined by Dr. Wilson, who
sent his reports to the Government of India, to the Commissioner of
Kumaon, and to the Deputy Commissioner at Almora.</p></div>

of good food, I found my spirits, which had fallen rather low, reviving
as if by magic; and, strange to say, after a few hours of happiness, I
was already beginning to forget the hardships and suffering I had
endured. I remained three days at Taklakot, during which time part of my
confiscated baggage was returned by the Tibetans, and, as can well be
imagined, I was overjoyed to discover that among the things thus
recovered were my diary, note-books, maps and sketches. My firearms, some
money, the ring I have before referred to as having been a gift of my mother, several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_452" id="Pg_452"></a>[<a href="./images/452.png">452</a>]</span>
mathematical instruments, collections, over 400 photographic
negatives, and various other articles were still missing,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> but
I was glad to get back as much as I did.</p>

<p>To Dr. Wilson's tent came the Tokchim Tarjum, his private secretary
Nerba, whom the reader may remember as having played an important part in
my tortures, the Jong Pen's secretary, and old Lapsang in a fine green
velvet coat with ample sleeves. As can be seen by perusing the Government
Enquiry and Report in the Appendix to this book, the above-mentioned
Tibetan officers admitted before the Political Peshkar, Dr. Wilson,
Pundit Gobaria, and many Shokas, that the account I gave of my
tortures&mdash;identical with the one in these pages&mdash;was correct in
every detail. They even professed to be proud of what they had done, and
used expressions not at all flattering to the British Government, which
they affected to treat with great contempt.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Karak Sing Pal, the Political Peshkar</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>I nearly got the Political Peshkar and the Doctor into a
scrape; for my blood, the little I had left, was boiling with
rage at hearing the Tibetan insults. The climax came when
Nerba refused to give back my mother's ring, which he had
upon him. In a passion I seized a knife that was lying by
me, and leaped upon Nerba, the ruffian who, besides, had
fired at me and had held me by the hair while my eyes were
being burnt prior to my abortive execution. Wilson and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_453" id="Pg_453"></a>[<a href="./images/453.png">453</a>]</span>
Karak Sing seized and disarmed me, but there was a
general stampede of the Tibetan officers, and thus our
interview and negotiations were brought to an abrupt
end.</p>

<p class="figcenter">Mansing Showing Cuts under his Feet</p>
<hr class="short" />

<p>In further conversation I now learnt how my release had been brought
about. Dr. Wilson and the Political Peshkar, having received the news
that my servants and myself had been beheaded, proceeded across the
frontier to make inquiries and try to recover my property. They heard
then from the man Suna, whom I had sent from Mansarowar with my message,
that I was still a prisoner, covered with wounds, in rags and starving.
They had not men enough to force their way further into the country to
come and meet me; besides, the Tibetans watched them carefully; but they,
together with Pundit Gobaria, made strong representations to the Jong Pen
of Taklakot, and, by threatening him that an army would be sent up if I
were not set at liberty, they at last obtained from the reluctant Master
of the fort<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> a
permission that I should be brought into Taklakot. The
permission was afterwards withdrawn, but was at last
allowed to be carried into execution, and it is entirely due
to the good offices and energy of these three gentlemen that
I am to-day alive and safe&mdash;though not yet sound.</p>

<p>Pundit Gobaria, who will be remembered as having
been mentioned in my early chapters, is the most influential
Shoka trader in Bhot, and on very friendly terms with
the Tibetans. He was the intermediary through whom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_454" id="Pg_454"></a>[<a href="./images/454.png">454</a>]</span>
negotiations were carried on for my immediate release, and
it was largely owing to his advice to the Jong Pen that
they resulted satisfactorily.</p>

<p>After a brief rest to recover sufficient strength, I recommenced
the journey towards India, and, having crossed
the Lippu Pass (16,780 feet), found myself at last again on
British soil. We descended by slow stages to Gungi, where,
in Dr. Wilson's dispensary, I had to halt for a few days
on account of my weak condition.</p>

<p>Wilson had here a quantity of my baggage, instruments,
cameras, plates, &amp;c., which I had discarded at the beginning
of my journey, and I immediately had photographs taken
of my two servants and myself, showing our wounds and
our shocking general condition. Photographs of my feet,
taken more than a month after I had been untied from the
rack, showed a considerable swelling, as well as the scars,
round the ankle and on the foot where the ropes had cut
into my flesh. In the full-face photograph here reproduced
can be noticed the injuries to my left eye, as well as the
marks of the hot iron on the skin of my forehead and
nose. Chanden Sing's legs, which were photographed on
the same occasion, though now practically healed, were</p>

Mr. J. Larkin</div><p><span class="smcap">It</span> was really wonderful how soon
we began to pick up again under the good care of Dr. Wilson and the
influence of proper food and clothing. When I saw my face for the first
time in a looking-glass, I nearly had a fit, so ghastly did it look; but
I felt more like myself when I had shaved off my beard of several months'
growth; and, after the ever-obliging Wilson, with a pair of blunt
scissors, had spent a whole afternoon in performing the functions of
hairdresser, I began to look almost civilised again. Clothes were a great
nuisance at first, but I soon got into the way of wearing them.</p>

<p>The injuries to my spine were severe, and gave me much trouble. At times
the whole of my left side became as if paralysed. Besides, I invariably
experienced the greatest difficulty in sitting down when I had been
standing, and in getting up when I had been sitting down. Through the
great strain they had undergone, my joints continued stiff and swollen,
and remained so for months. I could see comparatively well with my right
eye, but was unable to use the left at all.</p>

<p>When slightly better I made an excursion to Tinker, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_458" id="Pg_458"></a>[<a href="./images/458.png">458</a>]</span>
Nepal, there being a pass in the neighbourhood I had not
visited. Having crossed into Nepal at Chongur, I followed a
course towards 86&deg; (b.m.), until we came to the Zirri River,
descending precipitously between high snowy ridges. Then
I kept on the right bank of the Tinker River, first through
forests of firs, then among barren rocks and along ravines,
the track being extremely bad in some places. The general
direction was 88&deg; (b.m.) until the Tinker bridge was reached,
by which the stream was crossed, from which point I
travelled some three miles to 74&deg; (b.m.), and arrived at the
Tinker village, a few Shoka houses perched on the slope
of the mountain, having for a background the magnificent
snowy peaks dividing Nepal from Tibet. From the village
the track to the pass is easy, first to 78&deg; 30&#8242; (b.m.), as far as
the Zentim bridge, two miles off, where the Dongon River,
descending from 106&deg; (b.m.), meets the Zeyan Yangti,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> and,
following the latter stream for another four miles, one
reaches the Tinker Pass, the distance between here and
Taklakot being twelve miles. At 106&deg; (b.m.) I observed a
very high snowy peak, the Dongon.</p></div>

<p>Having seen all that I wanted to see here I made my way
back to Garbyang with all speed, as I was anxious to return
to Europe as soon as possible, and I travelled down to
Askote in company of Peshkar Karak Sing. The Nerpani
road had fallen in two or three places, and rough shaky
bridges had been constructed across the deep precipices,</p>

one of which can be seen in the illustration below. We
met with a hearty reception everywhere, and kindness after
kindness was showered upon us by all alike.</p>

<p>At Askote I was the guest of the good old Rajiwar, in
whose garden I encamped, and who bestowed upon me
every conceivable care and attention. Mr. J. Larkin, hastily
despatched by the Government of India to conduct an Inquiry
into my case, met me there, and, though still suffering
much pain, I insisted on turning back once more towards
Tibet, to help him in his task. By quick marches we reached
Garbyang, where a deputation of Shokas, who had returned
from Tibet, came to me, Mr. Larkin having gone on ahead.
Among them I noticed several of the men who had betrayed
me, and as I was told that there was no way of punishing</p>

them for their treachery, I took justice into my own hands,
proceeding with a stout stick to teach them some idea of
faithfulness, whereupon the whole village ran up to get the
fellows out of my clutches. Encouraged by the Tibetans,
the Shokas made some insulting remarks about Englishmen;
so the fight became general until, ill as I was, and
alone against some hundred and fifty men, I succeeded
in routing them. The thing might justly be doubted had
I not been able to take a snap-shot of them as they fled
helter-skelter.</p>

<p>Soon after leaving Garbyang, I overtook Mr. Larkin, and
we climbed towards the snows. We intended crossing over
the Lippu Pass into Tibet to give the Jong Pen an opportunity
of being interviewed, but he refused to meet us.</p>

<p>All the same, to give the Tibetans every chance, we climbed
over the Lippu Pass. It had been snowing heavily and it
was very cold. A Shoka had only a few days previously
been lost in the snow in trying to cross over, and had been
frozen to death. There were some twelve feet of snow, and</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_464" id="Pg_464"></a>[<a href="./images/464.png">464</a>]</span>
the ascent was by no means easy. However, after toiling
for some two hours we reached the summit of the pass,
and I slipped once more across the boundary into Tibet.
Dr. Wilson, the Political Peskhar, Jagat Sing, and two
chaprassis were with us. The illustration in which Dr.
Wilson appears holding an umbrella to shelter himself from
the high wind, with Mr. Larkin and our ponies on his right,
and showing also the pile of stones and flying prayers
placed there by the Shokas and Tibetans, was taken by me on
the pass. Having found a suitable spot where the wind
did not cut quite so furiously into our faces, we halted for a
considerable time and waited impatiently on the Tibetan
side of the boundary for the Jong Pen or his deputies, to
whom letters had been sent, to come and meet us;
but they did not put in an appearance, so in the afternoon
of October 12 I definitely turned my back on the
Forbidden Land. I was still far from well, but was glad
indeed at the prospect of seeing England and my friends
again.</p>

<p>We returned to our camp, a few hundred feet lower than

which represents me bathing at 16,300 feet, was taken by
Mr. Larkin. Chanden Sing, having broken the ice in a
stream, poured water from a brass vessel over me, standing,
with my feet on snow, in a high wind and with the temperature
at 12&deg; Fahr. I reproduce it to show that even
in my reduced condition I was able to stand an unusual
degree of cold. As a matter of fact, the water that had been
taken from under the ice immediately froze on my
shoulders, with the result that in a second I had icicles
hanging on each side of my neck and a shawl of ice over
my shoulders.</p>

<p>Having fulfilled our mission, Mr. Larkin and I returned
by very quick marches to Almora; and it was a great
satisfaction to me that in conducting the Government
Inquiry in an open Court, Mr. Larkin was able to obtain
ample testimony from Shokas and Tibetans as to my treatment,
all of which was duly reported to the Government
of India, and also to the Foreign Office and India Office in
London. A copy of the Inquiry and Government Report

from Tibet, were beginning to migrate to their winter
homes at Dharchula, and when we passed the settlement
many were already at work repairing the fallen-down roofs
of their hibernal habitations. A large number of Tibetans
with their sheep had also come over to winter in British
territory, and their encampments could be seen all along the
road wherever there was sufficient grass for their flocks.
The Tibetans&mdash;Lamas and officials&mdash;maintained a high-handed</p>

<p>and insolent demeanour as long as we were in
Bhot, which they regarded as part of their own country; a
fact observed not only by Dr. Wilson and the Political
Peskhar, who travelled with us up to the frontier and back,
as far as Askote, but also by Mr. Larkin, who more than
once was astounded at the impudence of Tibetans when on
British soil. It must, however, be said for them that the
moment they had come out of Bhot, and had to deal with
Hindoos instead of Shokas, their manner changed considerably.
Hypocritical deference and servility replaced haughtiness
and insolence. Near the frontier we encountered
hundreds of yaks and ponies laden with wood which the
Tibetans cut from our forests, and compel our natives to
take across into Tibet for the consumption of those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_469" id="Pg_469"></a>[<a href="./images/469.png">469</a>]</span>
Tibetans who do not come over to our side to spend the
winter.</p>

<p>At Askote the old Raot who had predicted ill-luck for
me when I visited the Raots' dwelling, came to remind me
of his prophecy. &quot;I told you,&quot; exclaimed the old savage,
&quot;that whoever visits the home of the Raots will have misfortune,&quot;
and I photographed the old scoundrel on the
spot, together with his mates, who listened with satisfaction
to the words that came from the lips of their prophet.</p>

<p>We proceeded with no delay to Almora, and from there
went straight on to Naini Tal, the summer seat of the Government
of the North-West Provinces and Oudh, where a conference
was held on my case by the Lieutenant-Governor.</p>

<p>Having there enjoyed the unbounded hospitality of that
able and energetic officer, Colonel Grigg, Commissioner of
Kumaon, I paid off my faithful coolie Mansing, giving him
enough for a start in life. He accompanied me to Kathgodam,
the terminus of the railway, and showed genuine grief
when Chanden Sing and I stepped into the train. As we
steamed away from the platform, he salaamed me affectionately,
having previously begged that, if ever I should go
back to Tibet, I would take him with me; only next time
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_470" id="Pg_470"></a>[<a href="./images/470.png">470</a>]</span>
he too must be provided with a rifle! That was the only
condition.</p>

<p>Chanden Sing, who remained as my servant, travelled with
me to Bombay, and from there we went direct to Florence,
the home of my parents, who had suffered in their anxiety
at home almost as much as I did in the Forbidden Land.</p>

<h4>GOVERNMENT REPORT BY J. LARKIN, <span class="smcap">Esq.</span>, MAGISTRATE OF THE FIRST CLASS.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mr. Arnold Henry Savage Landor having been reported to have
been captured and tortured by the Tibetans, I was sent up to
Garbyang in Byans to ascertain the facts.</p>

<p>Mr. Landor arrived in India on the 10th of April last. He proceeded
to Almora, where he arrived on the 27th idem. He stayed
there until the 10th of May, to make arrangements for his travels in
Tibet. At first he was advised to take some Gurkha soldiers with
him, but this fell through, as the military did not accede to his
request. He then, on the 27th May, arrived in Garbyang in Byans
<i>patti</i>. It appears to have been his intention to have entered Tibet
by the Lippu Lek Pass. This is the easiest, being about 16,780 feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_472" id="Pg_472"></a>[<a href="./images/472.png">472</a>]</span>
above sea level. It is the most frequented route taken by the traders
of Byans and Chaudans, and is adjacent to Taklakot, a mart for
wool, salt, borax, grain, &amp;c. He was, however, frustrated in this,
inasmuch as the Jong Pen of Taklakot came to know of Mr. Landor's
intention and took steps to prevent it. He caused bridges to be
destroyed and stationed guards along the route.</p>

<p>Moreover, he appears to have been kept fully cognisant of Mr.
Landor's moves through the agency of his spies in Garbyang.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances Mr. Landor was compelled to resort to
some other route, and selected the Lumpia Pass, which stands at an
altitude of 18,150 feet.</p>

<p>On the 13th July last, Mr. Landor, with a following of thirty men,
entered Tibet. He reached Gyanima, where he was stopped by the
Barkha Tarjum. This personage, however, after some persuasion,
consented to permit Mr. Landor and seven followers to go forward
to the Mansarowar Lake.</p>

<p>Next day the accorded permission was withdrawn, and Mr. Landor
and his party were turned back. The party returned three marches,
when Mr. Savage Landor determined to go to Mansarowar by the
unfrequented wilds.</p>

<p>On the 21st July, Mr. Landor, with nine followers, at midnight in
a terrific snowstorm, climbed up the mountain and went off, the bulk
of his party continuing their retreat to the Lumpia Lek. By this
strategic move Mr. Landor baffled the Tibetan guards (Chaukid&aacute;rs).
He carefully avoided coming into contact with any of the inhabitants,
and in order to do so was obliged to keep to the high mountains and
unfrequented wilds.</p>

<p>Travelling thus, with the aid of his compass, sextant and sketch
maps, he reached Mansarowar.</p>

<p>Here five of his followers declined to accompany him any farther,
so he paid and dismissed them. This was at Tucker. Thus Mr.
Landor was reduced to a following of four men. He went on, however,
and had accomplished but three marches more when two more
of his followers deserted him at night. These went off with some of
his supplies, all his servants' food, and ropes.</p>

<p>Mr. Landor was now reduced to the following of a bearer
(Chanden Sing) and a coolie (Mansing). Despite his misfortunes
he determined to push on: his intention appears to have been to
reach Lhassa.</p>

<p>He went over the Mariam La Pass.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> This attains an altitude of
over 16,000 feet.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the deserters had bruited about the information of Mr.
Landor's intention of getting to Lhassa.</p>

<p>While crossing the Nio Tsambo River one of Mr. Landor's yaks
went under. The yak was saved, but its valuable load, consisting of
all the tinned provisions, Rs. 800 in cash, three pairs of shoes, one
slaughtered sheep, wearing apparel, razors, skinning instruments, and
some three hundred rifle cartridges, was lost.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_473" id="Pg_473"></a>[<a href="./images/473.png">473</a>]</span>This accident was directly the cause of Mr. Landor's capture, as
he and his two followers, who were footsore, starving, and disheartened,
were driven to seek food and horses from the inhabitants of
the country. On the 19th of August 1897 they went to a place
called Toxem. The villagers received them well and promised to
supply them with food and horses. Next morning, the 20th idem, a
number of Tibetans came to Mr. Landor's tent bringing food and
ponies.</p>

<p>While Mr. Landor and his servants were engaged trying and selecting
ponies, the crowd increased and came up behind its three
victims.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without any warning, the Tibetans rushed on Mr. Landor
and his two servants, and overwhelming them by numbers, made
prisoners of them. They cruelly bound their surprised victims.
Then a number of soldiers (who had lain in ambush) arrived and
took over the prisoners. The first person to be dealt with was the
bearer Chanden Sing. He was accused of having taken his master
into Tibet. He was questioned as to this, and also as to the maps
and sketches found with Mr. Landor's things. I may mention that
when the arrests were made the Tibetans took all of Mr. Landor's
property, which they handled very roughly, damaging most of the
things. Hearing the Tibetans accuse the bearer, Mr. Landor called
out that his servant was in no way responsible for his having entered
Tibet. Thereupon a Lama struck him (Mr. Landor) a blow on the
head with the butt-end of his riding-whip. Chanden Sing was then
tied down and flogged. He received two hundred lashes with whips,
wielded by two Lamas. Then the prisoners were kept apart for the
night, bound with cords. Next day Mr. Landor was placed on a
horse, seated on a spiked pack-saddle. Mansing was put on a bare-backed
horse. They still were bound. Mr. Landor's arms were
secured behind his back. Thus they were taken off at a gallop
towards Galshio. When the party were nearing that place they came
up with a party of Lamas, awaiting them by the roadside. Here
Mr. Landor's horse was whipped and urged to the front. A kneeling
soldier, his musket resting on a prop, fired at Mr. Landor as he
went past. The shot failed to take effect. Then they stopped the
pony and fastened a long cord to Mr. Landor's handcuffs. The
other end was held by a soldier on horseback. The party then
continued their career, the Lamas having fallen in. While proceeding
at full gallop, the horseman who held the cord attached to Mr.
Landor's handcuffs, pulled hard at it to try and unhorse the latter.
Had this occurred Mr. Landor must have been trampled to death
under the troop of horsemen behind him. Thus they hurried onward
till they neared Galshio,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> when at a turn in the road a soldier was
seen kneeling at the &quot;ready,&quot; who fired a shot at Mr. Landor as he
came abreast of him. This, like the previous shot, missed its object.</p>

<p>Arriving at Galshio, Mr. Landor was torn off his pony. He was in
a bleeding state, the spikes in the pack-saddle having severely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_474" id="Pg_474"></a>[<a href="./images/474.png">474</a>]</span>
wounded his back. He asked for a few minutes' respite, but was
jeeringly told by his guards that it was superfluous, as he was to be
beheaded in a few minutes. He was then taken, his legs stretched
as far as they could be forced apart, and then tied to the sharp edge
of a log shaped like a prism. The cords were bound so tightly that
they cut into the flesh.</p>

<p>Then a person named Nerba, the secretary of the Tokchim Tarjum,
seized Mr. Landor by the hair of his head, and the chief official,
termed the <i>Pombo</i>, came up with a red-hot iron, which he placed in
very close proximity to Mr. Landor's eyes. The heat was so intense
that for some moments Mr. Landor felt as if his eyes had been
scorched out. It had been placed so close that it burned his nose.
The <i>Pombo</i> next took a matchlock, which he rested on his victim's
forehead and then discharged upwards.</p>

<p>The shock was consequently very much felt. Handing the empty
gun to an attendant soldier, the <i>Pombo</i> took a two-handed sword. He
laid the sharp edge on the side of his victim's neck as if to measure
the distance to make a true blow. Then wielding the sword aloft,
he made it whiz past Mr. Landor's neck. This he repeated on the
other side of the neck.</p>

<p>After this tragic performance Mr. Landor was thrown to the ground
and a cloth put over his head and face to prevent his seeing what
was being done to his servant Mansing. This must have been done
to make Mr. Landor believe that Mansing was being executed.
After a short time the cloth was removed and Mr. Landor beheld his
servant, with his legs stretched, tied to the same log. Mr. Landor
was kept for twenty-four hours in this trying position, legs stretched
as far as possible and arms bound to a pole, and Mansing for
twelve hours. To add to their misery they were kept in the rain
and were afterwards seated in a pool of water. The effect of this
torture was to strain the muscles of the legs and arms and injure the
spine.</p>

<p>When Mr. Landor's legs were unloosed from their cords, they were
so numbed and swollen that for sixteen hours he did not recover the
use of them and feared they were mortifying. Mr. Landor's property
was overhauled by the officials of Galshio and sealed up. On the
afternoon of the third day at Galshio, the two prisoners were taken
on foot to Toxem. It was a very trying march, inasmuch as several
rivers had to be crossed.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Toxem, Mr. Landor saw his bearer Chanden
Sing in a very precarious condition, as the latter had had no food for
four days. During all this time the prisoners were firmly bound and
carefully guarded. Next day, Mr. Landor and Chanden Sing were
placed on yaks. Mansing had to walk. Thus they were taken in
the direction of Mansarowar Lake. It was only on arrival at Mansarowar
that his guards unbound Mr. Landor.</p>

<p>Arriving at Dogmar the party was stopped by the Jong Pen of
Taklakot, who refused to give them passage through his district.
This was a very serious affair, as it meant that the worn-out prisoners
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_475" id="Pg_475"></a>[<a href="./images/475.png">475</a>]</span>
would have to be taken by a long circuitous route <i>vi&acirc;</i> Gyanima and
into India by the Lumpia Pass. This would probably have done for
them. Owing to the intervention of the Rev. Harkua Wilson, of the
Methodist Episcopal Mission, <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i> Kharak Sing Pal and Pundit
Gobaria, the most influential person among the Bhutias<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> of Byans,
the Jong Pen was compelled to withdraw his prohibition and give his
sanction to the prisoners being conveyed to Taklakot.</p>

<p>Arriving at this place the prisoners were hospitably received by the
Rev. Harkua Wilson, who is also a medical man. He examined
their injuries and attended to them. His statement discloses the
dreadful condition he found them in. The Tibetan guards made over
some of Mr. Landor's property to him at Taklakot. It was then
found that much property had not been restored. Mr. Landor had
a list drawn up from memory of his unrestored property. This list
(a copy) was handed to the Jong Pen of Taklakot.</p>

<p>I append the list. The Jong Pen has been called upon to restore
the missing articles. He urges that the affair did not occur in his
district, and that he is in no way responsible for the loss of the
property.</p>

<p>He has, however, promised to try to recover them, alleging that
the affair has been reported to a superior authority at Gartok. From
what I could gather here, it seems probable that all the missing
property, save the money, will be restored. I tried to see the Jong
Pen, but he pleaded illness, and the inutility of a meeting in which
he had nothing new to disclose. This personage is notorious in
these parts for his implacable hatred to English subjects.</p>

<p>The account of the affair as given by Mr. Savage Landor is fully
borne out by his two servants, and, moreover, the Tibetans who took
part in it did not try to hide it.</p>

<p>In the Rev. Harkua Wilson's tent at Taklakot, before <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i>
Kharak Sing, Gobaria and a large number of Bhutias, several Tibetan
officials corroborated the whole account as related by Mr. Landor.
The man Nerba, who had held Mr. Landor's hair when about to be
beheaded and have his eyes burnt out, admitted he had taken such
part in the affair. There can be no doubt that the above account is
true and unexaggerated, for the whole of Byans and Chaudans are
ringing with it. The Jong Pen of Taklakot was given ample opportunity
to explain the affair, but he declined to do so.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage Landor held Chinese passports, and his conduct
during his stay in that country did not warrant the officials to have
treated him in the barbarous, cruel way they did. I satisfied myself,
by careful inquiry from the people here, as to how Mr. Landor
behaved.</p>

<p>He is said to have been most munificent in his dealings with all,
and invariably affable and courteous. I had seen Mr. Landor just
before his entry into Tibet, and when I met him I could scarcely
recognise him, though he had then fairly recovered from the terrible
treatment he had received. I saw the marks of the cords on his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_476" id="Pg_476"></a>[<a href="./images/476.png">476</a>]</span>
hands and feet, and they are still visible after this lapse of time. He
complains that he is still suffering from the injury done his spine,
and fears that it may be of a permanent nature.</p></div>

<h3>ALMORA DISTRICT.</h3>

<h4>IN THE COURT OF J. LARKIN, Esq., Magistrate of the 1st class.</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>In re</i>&emsp;The Matter of the Tortures, Robbery, &amp;c., of A. HENRY
SAVAGE LANDOR, Esq., and his servants, by the Thibetan
Authorities.</p></div>

<p class="figc"><span class="smcap">Deposition of Mr. A. Henry Savage Landor</span>; <i>taken on the 4th
day of October 1897.&emsp;Oath administered by me.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>My name is Arnold Henry Savage Landor; my father's name is
Charles Savage Landor; I am by caste European. British subject;
by occupation artist and traveller; my home is at Empoli (Calappiano),
police station Empoli, district Florence, Tuscany, Italy; I
reside at London.</p>

<p>Having made up my mind to travel in Turkistan and Tibet, for
geographical and scientific purposes as well as to study the manners
and customs of those people, I obtained a British passport from the
Foreign Office and one from the Chinese Legation in London. I
had already a passport granted me by the Chinese Government
through the British Consul at Tientsin, China. I also possess letters
from Lord Salisbury and the officials of the British Museum. I am
prepared to submit all these for scrutiny. I arrived in India by the
P. and O. ss. <i>Peninsular</i> about the beginning of April. I travelled
rapidly up to Almora. I stayed there a short time to make arrangements
for my travels in Tibet. I entered that country through the
Lumpia Lek. I kept away from the road and paths, passing over
several ranges of high mountains, camping at very high altitudes,
for nearly three weeks. When I started I had thirty men with
me. Twenty-one of them left me when I was only five days in.
At Mansarowar Lake five Shokas declined to go any farther. I
paid them up and they left. It was they who gave the Lamas
of Tucker information of my intention to go to Lhassa. I had
proceeded but three marches towards the Maium La Pass when
my only two remaining Shokas deserted during the night. They
carried off all my stock of provisions for my Hindu servants, ropes,
straps, &amp;c. My party had now dwindled down to Chanden Sing
(bearer) and Man Sing (coolie). The latter was ill; I fear he is
developing leprosy. His feet were in a very sore and cut condition,
hence he could scarcely get along. I went over the Maium Pass
and followed the course of the Brahmaputra River for many troublesome
marches, until we reached the Neo Tsambo (river), in crossing
which one of my yaks sank and its load went down and was lost.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_478" id="Pg_478"></a>[<a href="./images/478.png">478</a>]</span>
I tried hard, by diving and swimming in this very cold and rapid
river, to recover my goods, but failed to do so, owing to the depth
and muddiness of the water. The load contained all my provisions,
some clothes, and all my shoes, cash rupees eight hundred, my
lantern, some ammunition, and sundry knives and razors. This
misfortune drove me to Toxem, which place we reached in a state of
starvation. It had taken us several days to get there. Owing to the
weak, fatigued, and starved condition of my two followers, I had to
seek to get them food and horses, as it was impossible for them to get
on without horses. I would not desert them, as I might have, as I
was still prepared to push on despite the many difficulties I had to
encounter hourly. Toxem consisted of one mud house and an
encampment of about eighty tents. The shepherds received us
kindly and consented to sell me horses and provisions. I encamped
for the night about two miles beyond the settlement. During the
evening several persons visited my encampment, bringing me gifts of
provisions. I invariably gave them money in return, certainly
three or four times more than the value of the articles presented.
During the night I was disturbed several times, and went out
into the darkness, but failed to discover any one. This, however,
was my nightly experience; hence I grew to attach little moment
to these noises. In the morning (August 20), two or three
Thibetans came offering to sell me provisions and ponies. While I
and my two servants were engaged examining and selecting ponies,
I noticed that numbers of villagers came up one by one, spinning
their wool or carrying bags of <i>tsamba</i> (meal), while others arrived
with more ponies. My servants, overjoyed at the hope of getting
mounts, rode first one pony and then another to suit themselves,
Chanden Sing, having selected one, called me to see it and try it.
I walked to the spot, which was about a hundred yards from my tent.
Naturally I was unarmed. The demeanour of these people had
been so friendly that it gave me no cause to suspect that any
treachery was anticipated. While I stood with my hands behind my
back, enjoying the delight of my long-suffering servants, I was suddenly
seized from the back by several persons. I was seized simultaneously
by the neck, arms, wrists, and legs, and was thrown down in
a prone position. I fought and struggled and managed to shake off
some of my captors, so that I was able to regain my feet; but others
rushed up and I was quickly surrounded and overpowered by twenty-five
or thirty persons. Ropes were thrown round my neck, legs and
body, and thus entangled, I was thrown three several times more to
the ground. I fought with my head, teeth, legs, arms, and succeeded
in regaining my legs four times. They overcame me at last by
strangling me with the rope which they had thrown round my neck.
Then they bound me hand, foot, and neck. When I had an opportunity
to look round, I saw Chanden Sing struggling against some
fifteen or twenty foes. He was quickly entangled, thrown, and
secured by ropes. Even Man Sing, the weak and jaded coolie, was
overcome by four stout powerful men, though he was not able to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_479" id="Pg_479"></a>[<a href="./images/479.png">479</a>]</span>
offer any resistance. He, too, was bound. While we were struggling
against our treacherous foes, some person gave a signal&mdash;a shrill
whistle&mdash;which brought up an ambush of four hundred armed
soldiers. These soldiers took up a position round us and covered
us with their muskets. Then they searched us and rifled us of any
things we had in our pockets. They next proceeded to my tent and
took possession of everything I possessed. They sealed up my
things in bags subsequent to having overhauled and examined them.
Then with shouts and hisses they led us prisoners to Toxem. There
we were separated, being placed in separate tents. Guards of many
armed soldiers were placed to watch us. In the afternoon of the
same day a <i>Pombo</i> (a man in authority), with several high Lamas and
military officers, held a Court under a gaudy tent. I saw Chanden
Sing led forward to this Court. I was led to the rear of the mud-house
to preclude my witnessing the scene. I heard Chanden Sing
being interrogated in a loud angry tone and accused of having been
my guide. Next I heard Chanden Sing's moans and groans.
Then a company of soldiers led me before this tribunal. I was
ordered to kneel, and as I would not do so, they tried to compel me
to do so by forcing me on my knees. I succeeded in maintaining a
standing posture. Then I beheld my servant Chanden Sing lying
down, stripped from the waist downwards, in the midst of a number
of Lamas and soldiers. I saw two stalwart Lamas, one on each side
of him, castigating him with knotted leather thongs. They were
laying on him with vigorous arms from his waist to his feet. He was
bleeding. As I could not be compelled to kneel, I was allowed to
sit down before the <i>Pombo's</i> officer. Then my note-books and
printed maps were produced, and I was interrogated, first as to the
route I had taken, then as to why I had drawn my maps and
sketches. I explained as best I could, partly through my servant
Chanden Sing and partly through an interpreter (a person who
styled himself a Gurkha and who knew a little Hindustani. He
wore the garb of the Tibetan). I explained to the officers that
Chanden Sing, my servant, did not know the route or anything
about the maps and sketches; that I had brought him as my servant,
and that I alone was responsible for the route taken by me, and for
the maps and sketches; that my servant was not to be punished;
that I should be if anybody was punishable. Thereupon one of
the Lamas struck me a hard blow on the head with the butt-end of
his riding-crop, and they continued to castigate my servant Chanden
Sing. I was led away captive, but nevertheless heard the moans of
my unfortunate servant. It began raining heavily, and I was taken to
a tent, where I was cruelly bound. Soldiers were placed within and
without the tent to guard me. I was thus kept the greater part of the
night with my arms manacled behind my back and my legs bound.
I was so bound that rest or sleep was impossible. The tent was
swarming with vermin, which quickly covered me; and I may here
remark that I suffered unspeakable tortures from this pest all the
time I was in captivity, as I was never permitted to wash, bathe, or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_480" id="Pg_480"></a>[<a href="./images/480.png">480</a>]</span>
change my clothes. In the tent my guard lighted a fire of yak's
dung, and the tent was filled with a suffocating smoke, which well-nigh
choked me. I was placed near a heap of this stinking fuel. I
must say that it was a night full of indescribable misery for me.
Though I was fasting all that day and night, yet my cruel jailers gave
me no food. I was thus kept a prisoner the following day until about
3 or 4 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> Then a soldier entered the tent and informed me that I was
to be flogged, my legs broken, my eyes burnt out, and then beheaded.
I merely laughed at him; I could not but think that this was said
merely to intimidate me. Half an hour later another person arrived
and signalled to my guard to lead me out. Not considering me
sufficiently secure already, they tightened my bonds and tied others
round my body. In this fashion I was taken to the sole house (mud
one) in the encampment. Here an enormous pair of heavy handcuffs
were put on my hands, which were still kept behind my back.
Even in this the treachery of my captors was shown, for they patted
me on the back and called me a good man and told me I was to be
taken back to Taklakot. This they said fearing I would resist.
Then, after locking the handcuffs, they made the key over to one
person, who rode away quickly with it lest I might possibly manage
to get the key and unlock my handcuffs. For this reason I was
never permitted to see or know who carried the key. Just then I
heard the voice of my servant, Chanden Sing, calling to me in a
very weak tone. He said: &quot;<i>Hazur! Hazur! Hum murjaiega!</i>&quot;
I endeavoured to get to the poor wretch's assistance. Upon my
trying to move towards him my several guards sprang upon me and
ruthlessly grappled me and threw me on to the back of a horse. I
could only call aloud to my poor servant that I was being taken to
Taklakot that day, and that he would be brought after me the
following day. I noticed that Chanden Sing was roughly seized
and hurled back into one of the rooms of the house, so that we
could hold no conversation. My other servant, Man Sing, had his
arms pinioned, and he was put on a bare-backed pony. The saddle
of the horse I had been thrown upon is worthy of description. It
was merely the wooden frame of a very high-backed saddle. From
this high projecting back or crupper four or five sharp iron spikes were
sticking out. These caught me on the small of my back. My
guard was then augmented by some twenty or thirty mounted
soldiers with muskets and swords. My pony was held by a horseman,
who rode before me. We set off at a furious gallop. Thus we
travelled for miles until we arrived at a spot where the <i>Pombo</i> with a
following of Lamas, banner-men, and soldiers, some two hundred in
all, were drawn up. Here my pony was allowed to go on first, and the
others reined up and drew aside. As I passed before the <i>Pombo</i> and
his following a person named Nerba (the Private Secretary of the
Tokchim Tarjum) deliberately knelt and fixed his musket on its rest
and fired at me from a few paces. The bullet whizzed past me: I
was still at a gallop, which no doubt saved my life, as the marksman
could not take a steady aim. My pony took fright and reared and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_481" id="Pg_481"></a>[<a href="./images/481.png">481</a>]</span>
plunged, but I maintained my seat, though I was being cruelly
pricked by the spikes in the crupper. My pony was then seized and
a long cord with a swivel at the end was fastened to my handcuffs.
The cord was about fifty yards long. The other end was held by a
horseman. In this way we all set off at a hard gallop, and in order
to accelerate the speed, a horseman rode by my side and he lashed
my pony furiously to make it go at its hardest; meanwhile the
horseman who held the cord did his utmost to pull me out of the
saddle, so that I would have of a certainty been trampled to death
by the cohort behind me. While thus riding furiously with my arms
extended backwards I had the flesh rubbed off my hands and knuckles,
so much so that the bone was exposed in places, and as the horseman
at the back tugged to get me off and I clung hard with my
knees, every tug brought me into forcible contact with the spikes in
the crupper and wounded me cruelly. The cord was one made of
yak's hair. It was strong, but it eventually gave way. The shock
unhorsed the soldier. I was all but thrown. This ludicrous incident
provoked much mirth among my guards. They stopped my
pony and the runaway steed of the dismounted cavalier. The cord
was retied with sundry strong knots, and after an interruption of a
few minutes we resumed our breakneck gallop, I being in front.
When nearing Galshio, and as I was going round the curve of a sandhill,
a soldier, who had been posted in ambush, fired a shot at me
from a few paces distant. The shot did not strike me. This incident
did not stop our headlong career, and we continued on until we
arrived at Galshio about sunset. This was the 21st August last. At
this place there is a large monastery on the crown of a low hill. At
some distance from the base of the hill, and on the plain, was pitched
the large white tent of the <i>Pombo</i>. Our cavalcade drew up there. I
was then roughly torn out of my saddle by two or three men. I
requested to stop for one moment. My captors refused me this and,
roughly thrusting me forward, said that, as I was about to be beheaded
in an instant, it was unnecessary. I was hustled to the left
front of the tent, where, on the ground, lay a log of wood in the
shape of a prism. Upon the sharp edge of it I was made to stand.
I was held by the body by several persons, while others pulled my
legs as wide apart as they could be stretched. Then my feet were
very securely tied by cords of yak-hair. The cords were so tight
that they cut into the flesh in numerous places, some of the cuts or
wounds being about three inches long. When I was thus secured
one ruffian (Nerba), whom I have alluded to above, came forward
and seized me by the hair of my head. He pulled my hair as hard
as he could. My hair was long, as I had not had it cut since the day
preceding my departure from London about the middle of March.
The others formed up in front of me in a semicircle. Then the
<i>Pombo</i> arose and was handed a bar of iron, which had been made red
hot in a brazier, the end grasped by the <i>Pombo</i> being bound round
with red cloths. He strode up to me, urged on by the Lamas, and
said jeeringly that as I had gone to see the country, my punishment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_482" id="Pg_482"></a>[<a href="./images/482.png">482</a>]</span>
would be to have my eyes burnt out. This was in allusion to what
I had said at Toxem, viz.&mdash;that I was a traveller and merely wished
to see the country. He then placed the red-hot bar of iron parallel
to and about an inch and a half or two inches from my eyeballs, and
all but touching the nose. The heat was so intense that it seemed
as if my eyes were desiccated and my nose scorched. There is still
a mark of the burn on my nose. I was forced to shut my eyes
instinctively. He seemed to me to have kept the bar of heated iron
before my eyes for fully thirty seconds or so. After some moments
I opened my eyes and beheld the hot iron on the ground. I saw
him take a musket from the hands of one of the soldiers standing by.
He placed this against my forehead and discharged it upwards, giving
me a severe shock, though nothing worse. Handing back the discharged
weapon to the soldier, the <i>Pombo</i> seized a long two-handed
sword and came at me. He swung it from side to side, all the time
foaming from his mouth. This foaming, I believe, was produced
artificially. He then motioned to the man who all this time held me
by the hair of my head to bend my neck. I resisted with all my
might to keep my head erect. Then the <i>Pombo</i> touched my neck
with the sharp blade of his sword as if to measure the distance for a
clean, effective stroke. Then he raised the sword and made a blow
at me with all his might. The sword passed disagreeably close to my
neck, but did not touch me. I did not flinch; and my cool indifferent
demeanour seemed to impress him, so much so that he seemed
reluctant to continue his diabolical performance, but the <i>posse</i> of
Lamas urged him on by gesticulations and vociferous shouts. Thereupon
he went through the same performance on the other side of my
neck. This time the blade passed so near that I felt that the blow
had not been more than half an inch from my neck. This terminated
the sword exercise, much to the disgust of the Lamas, who still continued
to urge the swordsman on. Then they held an excited
consultation. About this time my coolie, Man Sing, who had
frequently fallen off his bare-backed pony, arrived. The person who
held my hair then relinquished his hold, and another person came up
and gave me a forcible push, which gave me a nasty fall on my back,
straining all the tendons of my legs. Then my servant Man Sing
was brought forward and tied by his legs to the same log of wood to
which I was fastened. Then they made it appear that they were
going to behead Man Sing. I was pushed up into a sitting posture
and a cloth thrown over my head and face, so that I could not see
what was being enacted. I heard Man Sing groan, and I concluded
he had been despatched. I was left in this terrible suspense for
about a quarter of an hour. Then the cloth was removed, and I
beheld my servant lying before me bound to the log. We both
asked for food. This seemed to amuse our torturers, for they laughed.
In the meanwhile the day was beginning to wane, and our jailers
made us understand that our execution was merely put off to the
following day. After some time <i>tsamba</i> (meal) and tea, were brought
in, and it was stuffed into our mouths by our captors. We were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_483" id="Pg_483"></a>[<a href="./images/483.png">483</a>]</span>
kept out in the open without any shelter from the pouring rain.
We were sitting in one or two inches of rain and were drenched and
numbed with cold. I have already said my hands were manacled from
the back; so also were Man Sing's. But at nightfall our captors
increased our tortures by straining our manacled arms upwards as high
as they could be forced, and then secured them to an upright pole at
the back. This caused very severe pain, straining the spine in an
incredible way. Then they tied a cord from Man Sing's neck to mine,
the effect of which was to make us maintain a most painful position.
A guard encircled us, and with them were two watch-dogs tied to pegs.
The guard were apparently so confident of our not being able to escape,
that they drew their heavy blankets over their heads and slept. One
of them left his sword lying by his side. This made me conceive
the plan to try to escape. Knowing the extremely supple nature
of my hands, I succeeded in drawing the right hand out of my handcuffs.
After an hour's anxious and stealthy work I managed to
unloose Man Sing's bonds round his feet. In his joy at feeling
partly free, Man Sing moved his legs rather clumsily, which the
vigilant watch-dogs detected and gave the alarm by barking. The
guard were aroused. They went and fetched lights and examined
our fastenings. I had succeeded in replacing my hand inside the
handcuff. They found Man Sing's bonds loose and, giving him a
few cuts with a whip, warned him that if he undid them again they
would decapitate him, and refastened them. Then they placed the
light between us and put a shelter overhead to prevent the rain
extinguishing the light. At about 6 or 7 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> the following day they
undid Man Sing's feet. I was kept all that day until sunset in the
same uncomfortable and painful posture. Thus I was kept fully
twenty-four hours. During the day my property had been overhauled
and sealed. One of the Lamas picked up my Martini-Henry rifle and
put a cartridge in the breach, but failed to push it home firmly. He
then discharged the gun. The muzzle of the barrel burst and the
face of the Lama was much injured thereby. I laughed heartily at
this, and this apparently amused the <i>Pombo</i>, for he, too, joined in.
About half an hour after this incident my feet were untied. It was
then sunset. I found I had lost the use of my feet. It took my
right foot some two or three hours before the blood began to circulate
freely, but my left foot remained like dead until the following
day. That night my feet were secured by cords. A bowl of some
boiling steaming liquid, which I was informed was tea, was presented
to me to drink. The eagerness of the surrounding Lamas that I
should partake of it aroused my suspicion. When it was pushed up
to my lips I merely sipped it and declined it. After a short time I
felt most sharp, excruciating, pains in my stomach, which continued
for several days. I could not but conclude that the drink proffered
had been poisoned. The following day Man Sing and I were led
back on foot to Toxem, our jailers riding on horses. We had to go
at a great speed despite our severely lacerated feet. We crossed
several cold streams, sinking in mud and water to the waist. At
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_484" id="Pg_484"></a>[<a href="./images/484.png">484</a>]</span>
Toxem, to my great delight, I beheld Chanden Sing still alive. We
were detained there for that night. On the following day we were
placed on yaks' backs and hurried off towards Taklakot. Thus we
journeyed at an unpleasantly fast pace for fifteen days, from before
daybreak to nightfall. Our guards were bent on taking us <i>vi&acirc;</i> the
Lumpiya Pass; but as this meant a long protracted journey of fifteen
or sixteen days, over ice and snow, I knew that we would, in our
starved, weakened state, succumb. We were all but naked. This was
a day's journey on this side of Mansarowar, where our bonds had
been unloosed. We rebelled, and it well-nigh ended in a fight, but
our guards consented to halt at Dogmar, until they sent to inquire if
the Jong Pen of Taklakot would give us passage through his jurisdiction.
After much demur we were eventually taken to Taklakot.
This arrangement, I subsequently learnt, was entirely due to the good
offices and energy of the <i>Political Peshk&aacute;r</i> Kharak Sing Pal, Rev.
H. Wilson, and Pundit Gobaria. On arriving at Taklakot we hastened
to Rev. Harkua Wilson's tent, where we were warmly received,
attended to, fed, and clothed. My injuries were examined by the
Rev. Harkua Wilson, who is a hospital assistant, and who will be able
to depose to their nature and extent. In this gentleman's tent, and in
the hearing of several persons, among whom were <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i> Kharak
Sing, Rev. H. Wilson, and Pundit Gobaria, the man Nerba, above
mentioned, the Toxem Tarjum, and the Jong Pen's secretary, and also
Lapsang, chief secretary to the Jong Pen, admitted that my account
of the affair was perfectly true. Some of my property, more or less
damaged, was then restored me by the Tokchim Tarjum. I then
gave him two lists, one showing articles restored me, and the other
the articles missing. The <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i>, Kharak Sing, has copies of the
lists. I was in a very weak state, very exhausted through what I had
suffered and little food. It was due to the kind, liberal, and attentive
care and treatment of the Rev. H. Wilson and <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i> Kharak Sing
Pal that I recovered. The few ragged clothes I had on were literally
swarming with lice, as I had no change of raiment, nor was I ever
allowed to wash. I contracted the vermin from the tents I was kept
in and also from my guards who at first slept round me.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_485" id="Pg_485"></a>[<a href="./images/485.png">485</a>]</span>I took service as a bearer with Mr. Landor at Almora on the 27th
or 28th April last. I accompanied him on his trip to Tibet. We
went along through the wilds, encountering many hardships and
reached Toxem. There I insisted on my master buying ponies to
take us to Darjeeling. This resulted in our capture, for up to
then we had vigilantly kept away from the people. The people who
brought us ponies to buy played us false. They informed the
authorities, who sent soldiers, who lay in ambush behind the sandhills
until the crowd of horse dealers and lookers-on, whom we did
not suspect of treachery, surrounded and seized us. We were bound
with cords by the arms (at back) and legs. My master was more
cruelly tied than we two servants. We were taken to the R&aacute;ja,<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> who
accused me of having brought my master into the country. I was
then stretched out and two strong men with whips inflicted two
hundred stripes on me. I was questioned as to the maps. My
master called out that he, not I, alone understood them, and asked
that I should not be beaten. Thereupon a Lama struck him across
the head and removed him to a distance, so that I could not communicate
with him. They took all our property. Then we were
kept separate for the night. I was put in a room and my hands tied
to a pole. I could not sleep with the pain I was in. Next day my
master, with his hands tied behind his back, was put on a spiked
saddle and tied by a long rope held by a horseman. He went at a
gallop surrounded by about fifty horsemen armed with guns and
swords. Man Sing, our coolie, was also taken with him. My
guards informed me my master was to be decapitated at Galshio, and
that I was to be beheaded where I was. On the fourth or fifth day
my master returned. Meanwhile I was a close prisoner, bound up
without food. When I saw my master he was in a pitiful state. He
was handcuffed with enormous cuffs, clothes torn to rags, bleeding
from his waist, feet and hands swollen. Next day a guard on horseback
took us back, bound as we were, on yaks' backs, towards Mansarowar.
There I had my cords unloosed. My master was kept bound
until we got to Tangchim. We were eventually taken to Taklakot,
where the Rev. Harkua Wilson met us and saw our condition. He
attended to our wants. My master was well-nigh at death's door.
The Tibetans returned some of my master's property, but they have
kept about 475 rupees in cash, two rifles, revolver, two files, a lot
of soap, medicine, a butterfly dodger, matches, a box of mathematical
instruments, a quantity (400) cartridges, a large box of photographic
plates and negatives, three bags. We did not molest any one, and
paid more than four times the value for any food we bought.</p>

<p>I accompanied Mr. Savage Landor into Tibet. We were surrounded
and arrested at Toxem while bargaining and selecting
ponies. I was tied up hand and foot, and again tied to a log of
wood with my master. When I begged for mercy, they threatened
to behead me and struck me on the head with the handle of a <i>kukri</i>.
We were taken to Galshio. There the Tibetans were on the point
of beheading my master. They tried to burn out his eyes. They
fired at him twice to kill him. They tried to pull him off his horse
to have him trampled upon. He was subjected to many insults and
hardships. We were kept bound and guarded until brought to
Mansarowar. There our hands were untied. Chanden Sing was
with us. He received about two to three hundred lashes at Toxem.
I got off most lightly, as when the three of us were captured and
examined, I said I was merely the yak driver and not responsible
for anything. I lost nothing, but they took my master's property&mdash;three
firearms, some money, and other things; I cannot enumerate
them. We were brought back to Taklakot, where we met friends.
My master was made to sit on a spiked saddle and taken from

<div class="blockquot"><p>My name is Harkua Wilson. By caste Christian; forty-six years
of age; by occupation missionary; my home is at Dwarahat, police
station M. Dwara, district Almora. I reside at Gunji, Byans.</p>

<p>I am a missionary in the American Methodist Episcopal Society.
My work is in the northern <i>pattis</i> or Bhot. I accompanied Mr.
Savage Landor in July last as far as Gyanima in Tibet. We went
through the Lumpiya Pass. It took us four days from Lumpiya to
get to Gyanima. At this place the Barkha Tarjam declined to allow
me to go on, but he allowed Mr. Landor (who was said to be my
brother) with four porters and three servants to go on; but the
following day he withdrew this permission. We then returned three
marches. At midnight in a snowstorm Mr. Landor went up the
mountains, determining to go through Tibet by the wilds. He had
with him nine followers. He was then in perfect health and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_487" id="Pg_487"></a>[<a href="./images/487.png">487</a>]</span>
strength, and so were his followers. At the end of August I heard
that Mr. Landor had been arrested, and, fearing the Tibetans
would kill him, I hastened to Taklakot to do my utmost to save him.
There I learnt that Mr. Landor and his two servants were being
brought back. Hearing that it was the intention of the Tibetans to
take them <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Lumpiya, I, with Pandit Gobaria, Jai Mal,
and Lata, induced the Jong Pen of Taklakot to allow Mr. Landor to be
brought to Taklakot. On the evening of 7th September <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i>
Kharak Sing arrived there. At about 11 <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> on the 8th September
Mr. Landor, Chanden Sing, and Man Sing arrived. I took them
to my tent and heard their account of what had happened. I could
hardly recognise Mr. Landor; he looked very ill and seemed nearly
exhausted. I examined his injuries and found that his forehead had
the skin off and was covered with scabs. His cheeks and nose were
in the same state. His hair had grown long. He was unshaven
and unkempt. He was in rags and dirty, covered with swarms of
lice. His hands, fingers, and wrists were swollen and wounded.
On his spine at the waist he had an open sore, and the parts around
were swollen and red. His seat was covered with marks of wounds
caused by spikes. His feet were swollen, and so were his ankles.
The flesh about the latter was much hurt and contused, showing
marks of cords having been tightly bound round them. He was in
a very low condition. I attended to him, having given him a bath
and a change of clothes. I gave him food, but though he said he
was famished, he could scarcely eat. I am confident, if he had been
a few days longer in the hands of the Tibetans and had been taken
<i>vi&acirc;</i> Lumpiya, he would have died. After half an hour the
Tibetans brought some of Mr. Landor's things under seal. Some of the
Tibetan officials on one side, <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i> Kharak Sing and Gobaria
and myself on the other, made out a list of the property, which we
took over, and a list was prepared of the articles taken from Mr.
Landor and which were missing. Mr. Landor dictated the list from
memory. Copies of these lists were furnished to the Jong Pen. I
kept Mr. Landor at Taklakot until the afternoon of the 11th
September. Then I conveyed him by easy stages to Gunji, where I
have a dispensary, and attended to him. I am a hospital assistant.
I sent off reports to the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner.
Chanden Sing and Man Sing were also in a wretched state. The
former had marks of recent flogging from his waist to above his
ankles.</p>

<p>I am the Political <i>Peshk&aacute;r</i> at Garbyang in Byans. I knew and
reported that Mr. Henry Savage Landor had gone into Tibet. On
the 5th September I learnt from Bhotias that he had been stopped
at Toxem and reported it. I then proceeded to Taklakot in Tibet,
to inquire into the matter. On the 7th September, at Taklakot, I
learnt that Mr. Landor was a prisoner at Dogmar, and that the Jong
Pen would not permit his being brought into Taklakot, as this meant
that Mr. Landor would have to go to Gyanima and <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Lumpia
Lek. I then insisted on the Jong Pen allowing Mr. Landor a passage
to Taklakot, and warned him of the consequences if he declined.
The Jong Pen consented, but gave orders that Mr. Landor should
be conveyed hurriedly by night through Taklakot to the Lippu Lek.
I protested against this, and eventually Mr. Landor, on 8th September,
was conveyed into Taklakot. The Jong Pen had sent two
<i>saw&aacute;rs</i> to his guard to admit them. In the Rev. Harkua Wilson's
tent Mr. Landor related how he had been tortured. There were
several of the Tibetans present who had taken part in the tortures,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_489" id="Pg_489"></a>[<a href="./images/489.png">489</a>]</span>
and they signified that all of Mr. Landor's story was true. Among
them was Nerba, of Thokchim Tarjum, who admitted that he had
held Mr. Landor by the hair when about to be beheaded, and had
cut the nails of his fingers and toes. He admitted he had taken a
gold ring from Mr. Landor, which a soldier had taken from him. I
made a report of all this and sent (1) a list of Mr. Landor's property
restored him by the Tibetans and (2) a list of articles missing.
I know Mr. Landor had two rifles and a revolver when he went
into Tibet and a considerable amount of money. Mr. Landor
was in a very critical position; he was past recognition. He was
wounded on the face, body, hands, and legs. I went to the Jong
Pen and protested at the treatment given Mr. Landor. The former
boldly admitted that Mr. Landor had been treated as alleged, and
that it was their duty to act so. The Jong Pen promised to try and
have Mr. Landor's missing property restored to him. I know he
wrote off to the Garban of Gartok about orders issuing to the Toxem
Tarjum. He has engaged to send me anything recovered.</p>

<p class="tsr">Dharchula Byas, Bhot.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I herewith certify that I accompanied Mr. A. Henry Savage
Landor in his ascent up the Mangshan mountain, and that Mr.
Landor and a Rongba coolie reached an altitude of 22,000 (twenty-two
thousand) feet. Owing to the rarefied air, I and the other men
accompanying Mr. Landor were unable to go as far as he did. Mr.
Landor was at the time carrying on him a weight of thirty seers
(60 lbs.), consisting of silver rupees, two aneroids, cartridges, revolver,
&amp;c. During the whole time I travelled with Mr. Landor he always
carried the above weight on him, and generally carried his rifle besides
(7&frac14; lbs. extra). We all suffered very much during the ascent, as the
incline was very steep, and there was deep snow and much troublesome
<i>d&eacute;bris</i>.</p>

<p>I also certify that I took many photographs<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> of Mr. Landor and
his two servants after they were released, and Mr. Landor looked
then very old and suffering, owing to starvation and the wounds that
had been inflicted upon him by the Tibetans.</p></div>

<p class="tsl">Dear Mr. Landor,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Do you remember the night when we separated near Lama
Chokden in Tibet, you to proceed towards Lhassa, and I to return to
India?</p>

<p>I have in my lifetime, seen few such fierce snowstorms. The storm
had been raging the whole day and night, and the wind was blowing
so hard that we could not hear each other speak. I can only recollect
with horror at the dreadful anxiety I was in when you, with a handful
of men, escaped from the Tibetan soldiers watching us, and in the
dark fearful night proceeded to take your men up the mountain
range, with no path, and among loose stones and boulders, a way,
indeed, not even fit for goats.</p>

<p>That night, I well remember, you were carrying a weight much
greater than the one you usually carried, thirty seers (60 lbs.), for
when you left the tent you had in your hand a small bag with 200
extra silver rupees, and you carried your revolver, your rifle, and some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_492" id="Pg_492"></a>[<a href="./images/492.png">492</a>]</span>
extra ammunition. I assure you that I look back with amazement
at how you succeeded in pulling through the dangers and difficulties
of that night alone.</p></div>

<p class="figc">Yours sincerely,</p>
<p class="tr">(Signed)&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;H. WILSON,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br />
<i>American Methodist Episcopal Mission.</i></p>

<hr class="short" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="figc"><span class="smcap">Dr. H. Wilson's</span> <i>Statement</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I herewith certify that, having heard at Gungi (Byas) that Mr. A.
Henry Savage Landor, after losing all his provisions in a large river,
had been captured by the Tibetans at Toxem and had there been
tortured, I proceeded to Taklakot (Tibet) in the hope of obtaining
further news. At Taklakot the news was confirmed, and I heard that
Mr. Landor and two servants were brought back under a strong
guard. Some uncertainty prevailed as to what route he would be
made to follow, and efforts were made by the Tibetans to make him
proceed by the long, cold, and dangerous route <i>vi&acirc;</i> the Lumpiya
Pass, instead of by the shorter and easier route <i>vi&acirc;</i> Taklakot. We
heard that Mr. Landor and his two men were in very poor health
owing to the ill-treatment by the Tibetans, and no doubt the long
journey over ice and snow by the Lumpiya Pass left but little chance
of their reaching Gungi alive. At the request of Jaimal Bura, Latto
Bura and myself, Pundit Gobaria despatched a man to the Jong Pen
at Kujer to explain that we would be thankful and would consider it
a great kindness if he would allow Mr. Landor to travel through
Taklakot. At last, after much trouble, our request was granted.
The officer who brought us the news informed us that Mr. Landor
would be made to pass through Taklakot at night, and conveyed
directly over the Lippu Pass. The Political Peshkar Kharak Sing
Pal arrived in Taklakot that day from India, and we held a consultation.
We agreed to keep a watchman in the road all night, but Mr.
Landor did not go by. In the afternoon of the 8th, Mr. Landor and
his two men arrived. They had been rifled of all they possessed and
their clothes were torn and dirty. Mr. Landor and the two men
looked very ill and suffering, Mr. Landor's face being hardly recognisable.
He and his bearer Chanden Sing gave us an account of the
tortures that had been inflicted upon them at Toxem and Galshio,
and Mr. Landor showed the Peshkar Kharak Singh, Pundit Gobaria,
myself and many Bhotiyas (Shokas) twenty-two wounds on his spine,
feet and hands received from the Tibetans. Chanden Sing, who had
been administered two hundred lashes, showed numerous black
marks and open sores where the skin had been torn on both legs.
From Lamas and soldiers who had been present at Mr. Landor's
arrest and tortures I heard the following account.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_493" id="Pg_493"></a>[<a href="./images/493.png">493</a>]</span>An ambush had been laid, and Mr. Landor and his bearer were
caught by treachery when some hundred and fifty yards away from
their tent, inside which were the rifles and revolver. They made a
desperate resistance and fought for over fifteen minutes, struggling to
get at their weapons. Thirty men were on Mr. Landor and twelve or
fifteen held Chanden Sing, while four hundred soldiers armed with
matchlocks and swords, and who had kept hidden behind sandhills,
quickly surrounded them. They were tightly bound with ropes round
the neck, chest, and legs, and the arms were pinioned behind their
backs. Chanden Sing received two hundred lashes that same day.
Mr. Landor and Mansing were taken to Galshio three days later.
Ponies were provided for them, Mansing riding bare-back, while the
wooden frame of a saddle was provided for Mr. Landor, the frame
having several iron spikes sticking out of it in the back part of it.
During the long ride to Galshio these nails produced several wounds
on Mr. Landor's spine and back. Efforts were made, by means of a
rope attached to his handcuffs, to pull him off the saddle and have
him trodden to death by the hundreds of ponies of the Lamas,
soldiers and officers that came full gallop behind. Moreover, two
shots were fired at Mr. Landor. Mansing, unable to use his hands
that were bound, fell many times off his steed and remained some
two miles behind. When Galshio was reached Mr. Landor was
pulled off his saddle, and they told him that his head would be cut
off immediately. Dragged mercilessly by soldiers, he was taken to a
wooden log. Here they stretched his legs wide apart, and his feet
were made fast on the cutting edge of the log by means of tightly
bound ropes that cut into his flesh. Then while an officer held him
in a standing position by the hair of his head, a hot iron was passed
in front of his eyes and a matchlock laid on his forehead and fired.
Lastly, the head Lama approached with a long sword and swung it
right and left close to Mr. Landor's neck, as if about to cut off the
head. Mr. Landor remained composed and spoke no words. After
some twenty minutes Mansing arrived, and was tied to the same log
in front of Mr. Landor, and pretence was made to behead Mansing,
Mr. Landor's face having been covered with a cloth. The Lamas
professed to have been very astonished when, after having tied the
prisoners' hands high up to poles behind them, Mr. Landor asked
for some <i>tzamba</i> (oatmeal), meat and rice, and Mansing for some
butter.</p>

<p>The amazement of the Tibetans appears to have been even greater
when food was brought and Mr. Landor and Mansing partook
heartily of it and asked for more. Mr. Landor was kept chained to
the log for twenty-four hours, Mansing twelve hours. When they
were brought back to Toxem they found that Chanden Sing had been
kept four days tied hands and feet to an upright post, and he had
been given no food.</p>

<p>At Taklakot, an officer (called Nerba) confessed in my own tent,
and before Pundit Gobaria and the Political Peshkar Kharak Sing,
that he himself had held Mr. Landor by the hair when he was about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_494" id="Pg_494"></a>[<a href="./images/494.png">494</a>]</span>
to be beheaded. He had also fired a shot at Mr. Landor, and had
moreover been ordered by the Lamas to cut off Mr. Landor's toe
and finger nails, as well as a lock of his hair. The Taklakot Lamas
and the Tokchim Tarjum professed to be sorry at the Galshio Lamas
having behaved in such a cruel manner.</p>

<p>At Taklakot we made a list of Mr. Landor's property that was still
missing, and we gave a copy to the Jong Pen and one to the
Tokchim Tarjum, that they may try to recover what they can.</p></div>

and wounds</i></p>
<p class="tr"><span class="smcap">Taklakot, Tibet</span>, <i>Sept.</i> 8, 1897.&emsp;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I herewith certify that I have examined the wounds that Mr. A.
Henry Savage Landor received during his imprisonment at Galshio
in Tibet.</p>

<p>There are <i>five</i> large sores along the spinal column and the spine
itself has sustained severe injuries. At the time they were inflicted
these wounds must have caused profuse bleeding.</p>

<p>The feet bear the marks of cruel treatment. On the right foot are
still well visible to-day (nineteen days after wounds were inflicted)
<i>six</i> wounds, viz.&mdash;</p>

<ul><li>On the heel one wound one inch long;</li>
<li>Outside ankle&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;half-inch long;</li>
<li>Front of ankle&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;one inch long;</li>
<li>Top of foot, three inches above the toes, one wound one and a-half inch long.</li>
<li>Two small wounds on the upper part of foot.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the left foot the <i>four</i> wounds are of a very severe character, and
were produced by ropes cutting into the flesh.</p>

<ul><li>One nasty wound above heel, two and a-half inches long.</li>
<li>One wound below the ankle, one and one-fourth of an inch long.</li>
<li>One wound three inches above the toes, two inches long.</li>
<li>One wound on the heel, half an inch long.</li>
</ul>

<p>These wounds have caused the feet to be much swollen, the left
foot especially having been considerably injured. Its strained
tendons give still intense pain when touched and the foot is very
heavy, inflamed and swollen.</p>

<p>On the left hand there are <i>five</i> wounds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_495" id="Pg_495"></a>[<a href="./images/495.png">495</a>]</span></p>

<ul><li>On middle finger a wound one inch long and deep to the bone.</li>
<li>On root of middle finger, a wound half an inch long.</li>
<li>On small finger, a wound one-fourth of an inch long.</li>
<li>On third&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;</li>
<li>On first&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&quot;&emsp;&emsp;half an inch long.</li>
<li>The four fingers are still very swollen.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the right hand there are only <i>two</i> wounds.</p>

<ul><li>The first, one half-inch long, on the upper side of the hand.</li>
<li>The second, a quarter of an inch long on the second finger.</li>
</ul>

<p>Both hands are aching and much swollen, and the wounds upon
them were evidently produced by the heavy iron chain of the handcuffs.</p>

<p>On arrival at Taklakot (nineteen days after having been tortured)
Mr. Landor is still suffering from strong fever caused by his wounds,
and no doubt when they were fresh these must have given Mr.
Landor intense pain. His health and strong constitution seem
altogether shattered by the sufferings he has undergone.</p>

<p>His face, hands and feet are very swollen, and he appears extremely
weak; he himself attributed his great exhaustion to having been unable
to sleep for nineteen consecutive nights on account of the bad
sores on the spine and legs and because of the heavy iron chains
with which he was laden.</p></div>

where they were arrested and tortured. Chanden Sing has visible
to this day on both his legs, and twenty-one days after they were inflicted,
innumerable black marks produced by flogging. So severely
appears the punishment to have been administered, that large
patches of skin and flesh have been torn off by the lashing. Chanden
Sing is now in very poor health, and it is evident by his appearance
that he suffers greatly from the tortures and ill-treatment received at
the hands of the Tibetans.</p></div>

quanto appresso: nel mese di Dicembre appena giunto in questa
Citt&agrave; visit&ograve; il Sig<sup>re</sup> Henry Savage Landor e lo trov&ocirc; affetto=</p>

<p>Da <i>retinite</i> all' occhio sinistro con suffusione dei mezzi trasparenti,
e <i>da grave iperemia retinica</i> all' occhio destro. La vista era <i>abolita</i> a
sinistra, <i>diminuita</i> a destra=</p>

<p>La <i>colonna vertebrale</i> era dolente, se leggermente compressa con
un dito, o se appena percossa col martello da percussione il dolore
si faceva intenso, acuto specialmente nelle regioni lombare e dorsale.
La deambulazione non era libera ma incerta, la funzionalit&agrave; degli
sfinteri molto difettosa per cui difficolta della mizione e delle
evacuazioni.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_497" id="Pg_497"></a>[<a href="./images/497.png">497</a>]</span>Presentava poi delle chiazze ecchimobili sopra-malleolari e sopra-carpiche.
L'aspetto suo generale era di persona sofferente e molto
anemica. Fatte le cure che il caso del Sig<sup>re</sup> Landor reclamava, oggi
12 Febbraio notiamo; all' occhio destro risoluta la iperemia retinica,
aumentato il campo visivo, occhio che serve discretamente alla sua
funzione; all' occhio sinistro &egrave; molto turbata la circolazione endoculare
e quivi la funzione visiva non &egrave; ristabilita; non vede gli oggetti
e tutto gli fa confusione. La colonna vertebrale presenta sempre dei
punti dolenti in specie al rigonfiamento sacro lombare. La deambulazione
&egrave; pi&ugrave; corretta, ma gli sarebbe impossibile fare una passeggiata
lunga. La mizione e megliorata, non cosi la defacazione che &egrave;
sempre difettosa per impotenza dello sfintere.</p>

<p>Le condizioni generali sono megliorate, ma occorre pero al Sig<sup>re</sup>
Landor seguire la cura intrapresa, e specialmente la cura elettrica ed
idroterapica.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I hope that you have received my letter of some time ago and
that you may be quite well now. Are you still at Almora? I have
not yet got back your things from the Jong Pen, but I hear it is quite
true that all your property reached Tokchim a long time ago. I have
sent another letter to the Jong Pen, but cannot get an answer as the
Lippu Pass is now closed owing to a heavy fall of snow yesterday.
It is rumoured that a Tibetan officer is coming from Lhassa to Taklakot
to inquire after your case, and probably he may have reached
Taklakot yesterday, and after examining your things he will send them
down to me. Now I have nearly finished my work at this place. I
have collected the dues and paid them to the agents of the Jong Pen.
I will go back to Chaudas the day after to-morrow&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, on the 15th
of this month.</p>

<p>With kind regards and hoping to hear from you soon.</p>

<p class="figc"><i>Letter from the</i> <span class="smcap">Political Peshkar, Kharak Sing Pal.</span></p>

<p class="tr"><span class="smcap">Haldwani</span>, <i>January</i> 11, 1898.&emsp;</p>
<p class="tsl">My dear Mr. Landor,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>I hope that by this time you have reached safely home. I
have been very anxious as I have not heard from you or of your
safe arrival there. The dreadful day of the 8th of September is still
vivid in my mind, when I first saw you at Taklakot (in Tibet) after
you had been tortured by the Tibetans, and where I had come in
search of you.</p>

<p>I cannot forget your fearful appearance, with long hair and beard,
and your face, body and limbs covered with wounds and bruises.
When you arrived at Taklakot, in a few miserable rags stained with
blood, dirty and swarming with lice, and surrounded by the guard of
Tibetans, I could hardly believe it possible that it was you who stood
before me, so much you had changed since I had last seen you.</p>

<p>I am still deeply pained when I think of the pitiable condition you
were in, when you showed me 22 (twenty-two) fresh wounds on your
hands, feet and spine, without counting the injuries to your face.
And indescribable pain gave us too seeing your confiscated baggage
under seal of the Tibetan authorities, and to find it, when we opened
it, to be full of broken or damaged instruments and other articles
of your property.</p>

<p>I think that you may remember my inquiry and consequent anger
when the Tibetan officers and soldiers admitted their guilt of tying
you by your limbs to the stretching log and of placing you on a
spiked saddle; of removing forcibly your toe-nails and pulling you
by the hair of your head. You know quite well that I had no power
to do more than to report the matter to higher authorities, but I can
assure you that it was to me quite unbearable to hear from the
Tibetans that they had brought you to execution, and that they
boasted of having swung the naked executioner's sword right and left
of your neck, and that they had brought a red-hot iron close to your
eyes to blind you.</p>

<p>Your servants' condition, especially that of Chanden Sing, whom
like yourself the Tibetans kept prisoner for twenty-four days, and
who was given two hundred lashes, was pitiable beyond words.</p>

<p>I am anxious to see the photographs taken by Dr. Wilson of you
as you were when you arrived at Taklakot. I trust that by now you
may feel better and that the pain in your spine may have altogether
disappeared. I believe your rifles, revolver, ring, &amp;c., which I succeeded
in recovering from the Tibetans, must have reached you by
now through the Deputy Commissioner at Almora. The cash and
other articles have not been recovered, nor is there any probability
of getting them back. Hoping to receive news of you soon and with
best salaams,</p></div>

<p class="tr">I am, yours most obediently,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br />

reached me after the bulk of the book had gone to press</i>.]</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A PRIVATE LETTER FROM J. LARKIN,
ESQ., WHO, DEPUTED BY THE GOVERNMENT,
PROCEEDED TO THE
FRONTIER TO MAKE AN INQUIRY
INTO MY CASE.</p></div>

<p class="tr"><span class="smcap">Almora</span>, <i>August</i> 10, 1898.&emsp;</p>
<p class="tsl">My dear Landor,</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Yours of the 21st ult. I am glad to hear that your book on
your experiences in Tibet is nearly finished. I wish you may have every
success with it, as it is only what you deserve after your trials and
hardships in that difficult land of the ultra-conservative Lamas. I
am not aware that the Indian papers are attacking you. However,
they apparently do not get reliable information if they dispute the
fact of your having entered Tibet. We who were in some way
connected with your rescue and return have not been &quot;interviewed,&quot;
or we would give the authentic account of the affair.</p>

<p>I was on a few days' leave at Naini Tal when I heard of your
capture, tortures and expulsion from Tibet. I was deputed by the
Government to proceed at once to the borders and make an inquiry
into the affair. I set off at once, and I met you at Askot, where you
were being looked after by the Rajbar. What a change in your
appearance! When I saw you standing among some of the Askot
natives I could with difficulty identify you. You were bronzed and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_500" id="Pg_500"></a>[<a href="./images/500.png">500</a>]</span>
weather-beaten to such an extent that you were not distinguishable
from the natives. I do not think you can blame me for not
recognising you readily. Your forehead, nose and the part of your
face below your eyes were scarred, and helped to alter your appearance
very greatly. You did surprise me when you told me that you
would retrace your steps back to the borders on learning from me
that I was hastening on to inquire into your case. I had then seen
the twenty odd wounds you had on your face, wrists, feet and back.
I strongly protested against your undertaking the fatiguing journey
back across the perilous and arduous road, as I knew you needed
rest and good nourishment, and thought it would be wisest for you to
get back to Almora, and be under a good doctor.</p>

<p>You, however, with your characteristic doggedness, meant to
accompany me, and I must perforce let you. I was glad in the long
run, for you enabled me to make a fuller inquiry than I would otherwise
have been able.</p>

<p>As you know, and as I reported to Government, I found after
an inquiry on the borders that you had with great difficulty and
man&#339;uvring succeeded in entering Tibet, evading the Jong Pen of
Taklakot, and the Barca Tarjum at Gyanema, and crossing the
Mariam La (Maium Pass) and getting as far as Tuksem (Toxem).
You had been deserted by all the mountaineers who had started with
you and who had promised to accompany you wherever you went.
When you were left with the two Kumaonis, you were surrounded
and captured by the <i>Governor of that part of Tibet</i> and his men.
There, as a sequel to your innumerable fatigues, hardships, desertions,
and privations, you and your two followers were ill-treated and
tortured <i>by the Governor</i>. Have you not got a copy of my official
report? I remember you told me you were applying for it. If you
possess the copy, surely that will be sufficient to confound your
traducers. I saw from the public papers that my report was to be
laid on the table of the House of Commons by the Secretary of State
for India.</p>

<p>How did the photographs which we took up at the Lippu Pass
turn out? I should particularly like to have the one of the group
on the pass, and also the one where I am on horseback. I would
also like to have the one <i>I took of you having your matutinal bath
when the water froze in your hair and on your body</i> as it was thrown
on you by Chanden Sing; and no wonder it did, as there were ten to
twelve feet of snow lying about, and a hardy Bhotia (Shoka)
mountaineer had only a few days prior to our arrival been lost in
the snow on crossing the pass.</p>

<p>Doubtless it will afford you some pleasure to learn that you have
earned quite a reputation among the natives, both Tibetan and
Bhotias (Shokas), on account of your universal cordiality, generosity
and pluck. They are constantly inquiring about you, and relating
your many good traits. Should you ever think of returning here you
have made many friends, and you would get a very warm welcome
from the natives.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Pg_501" id="Pg_501"></a>[<a href="./images/501.png">501</a>]</span>
Dr. H. Wilson tells me that, when he took you over from your
captors, <i>the officials of Tibet</i>, you were in a dying state, and that he
only just got you in the nick of time. How are your eyes and spine?
I trust they are quite well again. I look back with pleasure to my
tour up to the border with you, and our return journey after your
journey into Tibet proper, <i>where you were subjected to tortures by
the Governor of the district thereof</i>.</p></div>

<p class="tr">With every good wish,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br />
Yours very sincerely,&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;Mr. W. E. Henley is not only steeped to the lips in Byronic poetry, but he
has also a very familiar acquaintance with the remarkable characters who formed
'the Byronic set,' and he knows the manners and customs of the Regency epoch
to an extent that gives him full mastery of his subject. There is originality in
the very form of this edition.</p>

<p>&quot;He manages to give in a few vigorous sentences vivid sketches of the wide
circle of Byron's friends and enemies.&quot;&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>&quot;The first volume is delightfully handy and the type excellent.&quot;</p>

little biographies&mdash;miniature biographies with such vital selection, such concise
completion without dry-as-dustness&mdash;such interest as no other writer but Mr.
